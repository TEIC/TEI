<head>Feature System Declaration</head>
<p>The Feature System Declaration (FSD) is intended for use in
conjunction with a TEI-conforming text that makes use of <gi>fs</gi>
(that is, feature structure) elements.
The FSD serves three purposes:
<list type="simple">
<item>It provides a mechanism by which the encoder can list all of the
feature names and feature values and give a prose description as to what
each represents.</item>
<item>It provides a mechanism by which the encoder can define
constraints on what it means to be a well-formed feature structure.
These constraints may involve constraints on the range of a feature
value, constraints on what features are valid within certain types of
feature structures, or constraints that prevent the co-occurrence of
certain feature-value pairs.</item>
<item>It provides a mechanism by which the encoder can define the
intended interpretation of underspecified feature structures.  This
involves defining default values (whether literal or computed) for
missing features.</item></list></p>
<p>The scheme described in this chapter may be used to document any 
feature structure system, but is primarily intended for use with the 
feature structure representation defined by these
Guidelines both in earlier versions (P3 or P4), and in the present
draft in chapter <ptr target="#FS"/>, which is also a candidate
for international standardization as ISO DIS 24610 (part one). Part two of
that standard, which will address validation mechanisms such as
that described in this chapter, is currently in preparation by a
joint ISO/TEI Working Group reporting to ISO TC 37/SC4. </p>
<p>As a component of an interchange standard for encoded text, the FSD
serves an important function in documenting precisely what the encoder
intended by the system of feature structure markup used in the encoded
text.  As application software is developed which makes use of encoded
texts, the FSD will also become an important resource that will allow
software to validate the feature structure markup in a text and to infer
the full interpretation of underspecified feature structures.</p>
<p>This chapter begins by describing how the encoded text uses header
information to make links to any associated FSDs.  The second, third, and
fourth sections describe the overall structure of an FSD and give
details of how to encode its parts.  The final section offers a full
example.<note place="foot">A fuller discussion of the reasoning behind FSDs
and another complete example are provided by <title level="a">A rationale for the TEI
recommendations for feature-structure markup,</title> by D. Terence
Langendoen and Gary F. Simons , in <title>Computers and the
Humanities</title>, 29, (1995). </note></p>
<div type="div2" xml:id="FDLK">
<head>Linking a TEI Text to Feature System Declarations</head>
<p>In order for application software to use feature system
declarations to aid in the automatic interpretation of encoded texts,
or even for human readers to find the appropriate declarations which
document the feature system used in markup, there must be a formal
link from the encoded texts to the declarations. However, the
schema  declares the syntax for the Feature System itself
should  be kept distinct from the feature structure schema, which is an
application of that system.</p> 
<?tei winita what do about FSD schema ?>
<!--<p>In the present version of these
Guidelines, this is accomplished by regarding the Feature System
document (FSD) as an external unparsed entity, which is referenced
only by name within the document that uses it.<note place="foot">In
SGML (but not in XML) a feature known as SUBDOC is available which
allows a document using one DTD (the FSD) to be nested within another
(the feature structure itself); this feature is not available in XML,
and is therefore not recommended where usage of XML is
intended.</note></p>
-->
<p>The association between an FSD and a document using the feature
structures it declares is made by means of a link from a special
purpose element in the TEI Header, <!--  Firstly, an
external unparsed entity must be declared for each FSD that is
associated with the encoded text.  That entity declaration gives a
name for the external entity and associates it with some file or other
resource on the host system.  It must also contain the keyword NDATA,
to indicate that the external entity contains unparsed XML or SGML
data conforming to some other notation, and a previously-declared name
for that notation. <note>In an SGML document, the SUBDOC keyword may
be used in place of NDATA and the Notation name to tell the processor
that the named file is a self-contained SGML document.</note> See the
example below for details of syntax.</p> <p>Secondly, the name of the
relevant FSD entity will be referenced within the TEI header of a
document containing feature structure annotation, --> as mentioned in
section <ptr target="#HDFSD"/>.  Within the <gi>encodingDesc</gi>
element of such a document's <gi>teiHeader</gi>, a special
<gi>fsdDecl</gi> element may be used for each distinct feature
structure type, as follows:
<specList><specDesc key="fsdDecl"/></specList>
Note that one <gi>fsdDecl</gi> element must be specified for each
distinct type of feature structure used in the markup.  The
<att>url</att> attribute provides a link to  the  entity
containing the actual declaration for that type of feature structure.</p>
<p>There may be multiple <gi>fsdDecl</gi> elements for a given FSD;
one for each type of feature structure it defines.  For instance, in
the following example, the file <ident rend="noindex" type="file">Lexicon.fsd</ident> contains an FSD that contains
definitions of feature structures for lexical entries (<tag>fs
type="entry"</tag>) and lexical subentries (<tag>fs
type="subentry"</tag>). The file <ident rend="noindex" type="file">Gazdar.fsd</ident> contains another FSD which contains
definition of a feature structure called <ident>GPSG</ident>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
   <TEI>
   <teiHeader>
      <fileDesc> <!-- ... --> </fileDesc>
      <encodingDesc>
           <!-- ... -->
           <fsdDecl type="GPSG" url="Gazdar.fsd"/>
           <fsdDecl type="entry" url="Lexicon.fsd"/>
           <fsdDecl type="subentry" url="Lexicon.fsd"/>
           <!-- ... -->
      </encodingDesc>
   </teiHeader>
   <!-- The text goes here -->
   </TEI></egXML>
As this example shows, a <gi>fsdDecl</gi> is given within the
<gi>encodingDesc</gi> for each distinct value used as the
<att>type</att> of the <gi>fs</gi> elements in the document itself. In
this case, for example, the feature system declaration used by feature
structures of types <val>entry</val> and <val>subentry</val> is to
be found in the entity at the URL <ident>Lexicon.fsd</ident>.
</p>
<p>The current recommendations provide no way of enforcing uniqueness
of the <att>type</att> values for the <gi>fsdDecl</gi> element, nor of
requiring that every <att>type</att> value specified on a <gi>fs</gi>
element be also declared on an <gi>fsdDecl</gi> element. Encoders
requiring such constraints (which might have some obvious utility in
assisting the consistency and accuracy of tagging) are recommended to
develop tools to enforce them, using such mechanisms as Schematron
assertions. </p>
<p><!--The module for feature system declarations is contained in the file
<ident type="file">declarefs.dtd</ident> or <ident type="file">declarefs.rng</ident>. The former has the public
identifier <ident type="fpi">-//TEI P5//DTD Auxiliary Document Type:

the following elements:

This module has no particular dependencies on any other TEI module;
for most practical purposes, however, it should be used in conjunction
with the standard tei, header, and core modules, as well as the iso-fs
module discussed in chapter <ptr target="#FS"/>. The selection and
combination of modules to form a TEI schema is described in <ptr target="#STIN"/>.</p>

</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="FDOV"><head>The Overall Structure of a Feature System Declaration</head>
<p>A feature system declaration is encoded as a document of type
<gi>teifsd</gi>.  It has two parts:  an obligatory header (which
provides bibliographic information for the file) and a set of feature
structure declarations (each of which defines one type of feature
structure).  Each feature structure declaration in turn has three parts:
an optional description (which gives a prose comment on what that type
of feature structure encodes), an obligatory set of feature declarations
(which specify range constraints and default values for the features in
that type of structure), and optional feature structure constraints
(which specify co-occurrence restrictions on feature values).  The
header is encoded as a <gi>teiHeader</gi>, just as for any TEI
document; see chapter <ptr target="#HD"/>.  The other components listed
above are unique to feature system declarations.  Thus, the following
new elements are involved:
<specList>
<specDesc key="teifsd"/>
<specDesc key="fsDecl"/>
<specDesc key="fsDescr"/>
<specDesc key="fDecl"/>
<specDesc key="fsConstraints"/></specList></p>
<p>Feature declarations and feature structure constraints are described
in the next two sections of this chapter.  Note that the specification
of similar <gi>fsDecl</gi> elements can be simplified by devising an
inheritance hierarchy for the feature structure types.  Each
<gi>fsDecl</gi> may name a <att>baseType</att> from which it inherits
feature declarations and constraints.  For instance, suppose that
<tag>fsDecl type="Basic"</tag> contains <tag>fDecl name="One"</tag> and
<tag>fDecl name="Two"</tag>, and that <tag>fsDecl type="Derived"
baseType="Basic"</tag> contains just <tag>fDecl name="Three"</tag>.  Then
any instance of <tag>fs type="Derived"</tag> may include all three
features.  This is because <tag>fsDecl type="Derived"</tag> inherits the
two feature declarations from <tag>fsDecl type="Basic"</tag> when it
specifies a <att>baseType</att> of <val>Basic</val>.</p>
<p>The following sample shows the overall structure of a complete FSD:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <teifsd>
     <teiHeader>
        <!-- The header is as for any TEI document -->
     </teiHeader>
     <fsDecl type="SomeName">
        <fsDescr>Describes what this type of fs represents</fsDescr>
        <fDecl name="featureOne">
           <!-- The declaration for featureOne -->
        </fDecl>
        <fDecl name="featureTwo">
           <!-- The declaration for featureTwo -->
        </fDecl>
        <fsConstraints>
           <!-- The feature structure constraints go here -->
        </fsConstraints>
     </fsDecl>
     <fsDecl type="AnotherType">
           <!-- Declare another type of feature structure -->
     </fsDecl>
  </teifsd></egXML></p>
<p>The formal definition of the <gi>teifsd</gi> and its components is as follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DFDFSD2" n="Feature System Declaration">
&teifsd;
&fsDecl;&fsDescr;
</specGrp>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="FDFD"><head>Feature Declarations</head>
<p>Each feature is declared in an <gi>fDecl</gi> element whose
<att>name</att> attribute identifies the feature being declared; this
matches the <att>name</att> attribute of the <gi>f</gi> elements it
declares.  An <gi>fDecl</gi> also has an <att>org</att> attribute
which declares the organizing principle for the values of the
<gi>f</gi> elements it declares.  That is, the value may be a 
<val>unit</val> (a single value), a 
<val>set</val> (in which the order is not significant and
there are no duplicates), a <val>bag</val> (in which
the order is not significant but duplicates are allowed), or a <val>list</val> (in which the order is significant).  (See
definition of <att>org</att> attribute of <gi>f</gi> in section <ptr target="#FSSS"/>.)  An <gi>fDecl</gi> has three parts: an optional
prose description (which should explain what the feature and its
values represent), an obligatory range specification (which declares
what values the feature is allowed to have), and an optional default
specification (which declares what default value should be supplied
when the named feature does not appear in an <gi>fs</gi>).  A single
unconditional default value may be specified, or multiple conditional
values.  If no default is specified, or if none of the conditions is
met, then the default value is <gi>none</gi>; in other words, the
feature is not applicable (see section <ptr target="#FSBO"/> for a
discussion of the <gi>none</gi> element).</p>
<p>The following elements are  used in feature system declarations:
<specList>
<specDesc key="fDecl" atts="name org"/>
<specDesc key="fDescr"/>
<specDesc key="vRange"/>
<specDesc key="vDefault"/>
<specDesc key="if"/>
<specDesc key="then"/></specList></p>
<p>The logic for validating feature values and for matching the
conditions for supplying default values is based on the operation of
<term>subsumption</term>.  Subsumption is a standard operation in
feature-structure-based formalisms.  Informally, a feature structure
<emph>fs</emph> subsumes all feature structures that are at least as
informative as itself; that is, all feature structures that specify at
least as many features as <emph>fs</emph> with values at least as
informative as those given in <emph>fs</emph> (Pereira 1987:6; see also
Shieber 1986:14–16).<note place="foot"><bibl>Fernando C. N. Pereira, <title>Grammars and logics of partial
information</title>, SRI International Technical Note 420 (Menlo
Park, CA: SRI International, 1987)</bibl>, and
<bibl>Stuart Shieber, <title>An Introduction to Unification-based
Approaches to Grammar</title>, CSLI Lecture Notes 4 (Palo Alto,
CA: Center for the Study of Language and Information,
1986).</bibl></note>
A more formal definition requires that we first define the notion of
<q>domain of a feature structure.</q> A feature structure can be viewed
as a partial function that maps features onto values; when viewed in
this way, the domain of a feature structure is the set of top-level
features it contains (that is, excluding features in embedded feature
structures).  We can now offer a more precise definition:
<q rend="display">     <emph>fs</emph> subsumes <emph>fs′</emph> if both are
     identical primitive values, or if the domain of <emph>fs</emph>
     is a subset of the domain of <emph>fs′</emph>, and for every
     feature <emph>f</emph> in the domain of <emph>fs</emph>, the
     value of <emph>f</emph> in <emph>fs</emph> subsumes the value
     of <emph>f</emph> in <emph>fs′</emph>.</q></p>
<p>Following the spirit of the informal definition above, we can extend
subsumption in a straightforward way to cover alternation, negation,
special primitive values, and the use of attributes in the markup.
For instance, a <gi>vAlt</gi> containing the value <val>v</val> subsumes <val>v</val>.  The negation
of a value <val>v</val> (represented by means of the
<gi>vNot</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#FVNOT"/>)
subsumes any value that is not <val>v</val>; for
example <code>&lt;vNot&gt;&lt;numeric value='0'/&gt;&lt;/vNot&gt;</code> subsumes any
numeric value other than zero.
The value <gi>binary value="true"</gi> subsumes any value that is in
the range of a feature, and the value <gi>binary value="false"</gi>
subsumes any value that is not.  The value <gi>fs
type="X"/</gi> subsumes any feature structure of type <val>X</val>.
</p>
<!-- restore discussion of subsumption removed from old FS here? -->
<p>As an example of feature declarations, consider the following extract
from Gazdar et al's <title>Generalized Phrase Structure
     Grammar</title>.<note place="foot"><bibl>Gerald
Gazdar, Ewan Klein, Geoffrey Pullum, and Ivan Sag: <title>Generalized
     Phrase Structure Grammar</title>, (Harvard University
Press, 1985)</bibl></note> In the appendix to their book (pages 245–247), they
propose a feature system for English of which this is just a sampling:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">feature    value range
INV        {+, -}
CONJ       {and, both, but, either, neither, nor, or, NIL}
COMP       {for, that, whether, if, NIL}
AGR        CAT
PFORM      {to, by, for, ...}</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Feature specification defaults
FSD 1:  [-INV]
FSD 2:  ~[CONJ]
FSD 9:  [INF, +SUBJ] --> [COMP for]</egXML></p>
<p>The INV feature, which encodes whether or not a sentence is inverted,
allows only the values plus (+) and minus (-).  If the feature is not
specified, then the default rule (FSD 1 above) says that a value of
minus is always assumed.  The feature declaration for this feature would
be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><fDecl name="INV">
  <fDescr>inverted sentence</fDescr>
   <vRange><vAlt>
      <binary value="true"/>
      <binary value="false"/>
   </vAlt></vRange>
  <vDefault><binary value="false"/></vDefault>
</fDecl></egXML></p>
<p>The value range is specified as an alternation (more precisely, an
exclusive disjunction), which can be reporesented by  the
<gi>binary</gi> feature value.  <!--of <gi>plus/</gi> and <gi>minus/</gi>.-->  That is,
the value must be either true or false, but cannot be both or neither.</p>
<p>The CONJ feature indicates the surface form of the conjunction used
in a construction.  The ~ in the default rule (see FSD 2 above)
represents negation.  This means that by default the feature is not
applicable, in other words, no conjunction is taking place.  This
corresponds to the simple value <gi>none</gi><!--; see section <ptr target="#FSBO"/>-->.  Note that this is distinct from the NIL value allowed in
the value range.  In their analysis, NIL means that the phenomenon of
conjunction is taking place but there is no explicit conjunction in the
surface form of the sentence.  The feature declaration for this feature
would be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><fDecl name="CONJ">
   <fDescr>surface form of the conjunction</fDescr>
   <vRange>
      <vAlt>
        <symbol value="and"/>
        <symbol value="both"/>
        <symbol value="but"/>
        <symbol value="either"/>
        <symbol value="neither"/>
        <symbol value="nor"/>
        <symbol value="or"/>
        <symbol value="NIL"/>
      </vAlt>
   </vRange>
   <vDefault><binary value="false"/></vDefault>
</fDecl></egXML>
 <!-- binary was "none" -->
Note that the <gi>vDefault</gi> is not strictly necessary in this case,
since <gi>none</gi> is the value assumed in the absence of a default
specification.</p>
<p>The COMP feature indicates the surface form of the complementizer
used in a construction.  In value range, it is analogous to CONJ.
However, its default rule (see FSD 9 above) is conditional.  It says
that if the verb form is infinitival (the VFORM feature is not mentioned
in the rule since it is the only feature that can take INF as a value),
and the construction has a subject, then a <mentioned>for</mentioned> complement
must be used.  For instance, to make John the subject of the infinitive
in <mentioned>It is necessary to go,</mentioned> a <mentioned>for</mentioned> complement
must be used; that is, <mentioned>It is necessary for John to go.</mentioned>
The feature declaration for this feature would be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><fDecl name="COMP">
   <fDescr>surface form of the complementizer</fDescr>
   <vRange>
      <vAlt>
        <symbol value="for"/>
        <symbol value="that"/>
        <symbol value="whether"/>
        <symbol value="if"/>
        <symbol value="NIL"/>
      </vAlt></vRange>
   <vDefault>
      <if><fs><f name="VFORM"><symbol value="INF"/></f>
              <f name="SUBJ"><binary value="true"/></f></fs>
      <then/><symbol value="for"/></if>
   </vDefault>
</fDecl></egXML></p>
<p>The AGR feature stores the features relevant to subject-verb
agreement.  Gazdar et al. specify the range of this feature as CAT.
This means that the value is a <term rend="noindex">category</term>, which
is their term for a feature structure.  This is actually too weak a
statement.  Not just any feature structure is allowable here; it must be
a feature structure for agreement (which is defined in the complete
example at the end of the chapter to contain the features of person and
number).  The following feature declaration encodes this constraint on
the value range:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><fDecl name="AGR">
   <fDescr>agreement for person and number</fDescr>
   <vRange><fs type="Agreement"/></vRange>
</fDecl></egXML>
That is, the value must be a feature structure of type <val>Agreement</val>.  The complete example at the end of this
chapter includes the <tag>fsDecl type="Agreement"</tag> which includes
<tag>fDecl name="PERS"</tag> and <tag>fDecl name="NUM"</tag>.</p>
<p>The PFORM feature indicates the surface form of the preposition used
in a construction.  Since PFORM is specified above as an open set,
<gi>string</gi> is used in the range specification below rather than
<gi>symbol</gi>.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><fDecl name="PFORM">
   <fDescr>word form of a preposition</fDescr>
   <vRange><vNot><string/></vNot></vRange>
</fDecl></egXML>
This example makes use of a negated value:    <code>&lt;vNot&gt;&lt;string/&gt;&lt;/vNot&gt;</code>
subsumes any string that is not the empty
string.</p>
<p>The formal definition for feature declarations follows.  Note that
the class <ident type="class">model.featureVal</ident> includes all possible
single feature values, including a <gi>vAlt</gi>.
<specGrp xml:id="DFDX" n="Feature definitions">
&fDecl;&fDescr;&vRange;&vDefault;&if;&then;
</specGrp></p></div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="FDFS"><head>Feature Structure Constraints</head>
<p>Ensuring the validity of feature structures may require much more
than simply specifying the range of allowed values for each feature.
There may be constraints on the co-occurrence of one feature value with
the value of another feature in the same feature structure or in an
embedded feature structure.</p>
<p>Such constraints on valid feature structures are expressed as a
series of conditional and biconditional tests in the
<gi>fsConstraints</gi> part of an <gi>fsDecl</gi>.  A particular feature
structure is valid only if it meets all the constraints.  The
<gi>cond</gi> element encodes the conventional if-then conditional of
boolean logic which succeeds when both the antecedent and consequent are
true, or whenever the antecedent is false.  The <gi>bicond</gi> element
encodes the biconditional (if and only if) operation of boolean logic.
It succeeds only when both antecedent and consequent are true, or both
are false.  In feature structure constraints the antecedent and
consequent are expressed as feature structures; they are considered true
if they <term rend="noindex">subsume</term><index><term>subsumption</term><index><term>of feature structures</term></index></index>
(see section <ptr target="#FDFD"/>) the target feature structure.  The
following elements make up the <gi>fsConstraints</gi> part of an FSD:
<specList><specDesc key="fsConstraints"/><specDesc key="cond"/><specDesc key="bicond"/><specDesc key="then"/><specDesc key="iff"/></specList></p>
<p>For an example of feature structure constraints, consider the
following <soCalled>feature co-occurrence restrictions</soCalled>
extracted from the feature system for English proposed by Gazdar, et al. (1985:246–247):
<eg><![CDATA[FCR 1:  [+INV] &#8594; [+AUX, FIN]
FCR 7:  [BAR 0] &equiv; [N] &amp; [V] &amp; [SUBCAT]
FCR 8:  [BAR 1] &#8594; ~[SUBCAT]]]></eg></p>
<p>The first constraint says that if a construction is inverted, it must
also have an auxiliary and a finite verb form.  That is,
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><cond>
   <fs><f name="INV"><binary value="true"/></f></fs>
 <then/>
   <fs><f name="AUX"><binary value="true"/></f>
       <f name="VFORM"><symbol value="FIN"/></f>
   </fs>
</cond></egXML></p>
<p>The second constraint says that if a construction has a BAR value of
zero (i.e., it is a sentence), then it must have a value for the
features N, V, and SUBCAT.  By the same token, because it is a
biconditional, if it has values for N, V, and SUBCAT, it must have
BAR='0'.  That is,
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><bicond>
   <fs><f name="BAR"><symbol value="0"/></f></fs>
   <iff/>
   <fs>
      <f name="N"><binary value="true"/></f>
      <f name="V"><binary value="true"/></f>
      <f name="SUBCAT"><binary value="true"/></f>
   </fs>
</bicond></egXML></p>
<!-- <binary> was <any>-->
<p>The final constraint says that if a construction has a BAR value of 1
(i.e., it is a phrase), then the SUBCAT feature is irrelevant (~).
This is not biconditional, since there are other instances under which
the SUBCAT feature is irrelevant.  That is,
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><cond>
   <fs><f name="BAR"><symbol value="1"/></f></fs>
  <then/>
    <fs><f name="SUBCAT"><binary value="false"/></f></fs>
</cond></egXML></p>
<!-- <binary> was <none>-->
<p>The formal declaration for feature structure constraints is as follows.
Note that <gi>cond</gi> and <gi>bicond</gi> use the empty tags
<gi>then</gi> and <gi>iff</gi>, respectively, to separate the antecedent
and consequent.  These are primarily for the sake of enhancing human
readability.

Institute of Linguistics, Dallas, TX) on January 28, 1991.
Revised April 8, 1993 to match the specification of FSDs
in version P2 of the TEI Guidelines. Revised again December 2004 to
be consistent with  the feature structure representation standard
jointly developed with ISO TC37/SC4.

<sourceDesc>
<p>This sample FSD does not describe a complete feature
system.  It is based on extracts from the feature system
for English presented in the appendix (pages 245–247) of
Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, by Gazdar, Klein,
Pullum, and Sag (Harvard University Press, 1985).</p>
