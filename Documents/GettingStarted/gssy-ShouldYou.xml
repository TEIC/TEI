    <head>Should you use the TEI?</head>
    
    <div>
        <head>Is your journey necessary?</head>
        <p>It may seem counter-intuitive for us to be questioning whether
            you need to use the TEI in a Getting Started guide intended to
            ease you into doing that very thing. However, it may be that
            the TEI is not the most suitable solution for what you want to
            accomplish. To be clear, you can encode any form of
            text-bearing object, and even objects that don't have any text,
            in TEI. People also use the TEI to record only metadata about
            objects. If you are undertaking a text-encoding project in
            linguistics, social sciences, library sciences, or humanities
            then it is likely that the TEI is a good fit for your needs.
            Nonetheless there are situations where, if you don't already
            have a TEI infrastructure to hand, your journey may not be
            necessary at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <head>Why not just HTML?</head>
        <p>Quite frequently people know that their main publication output
            will be in HTML on the web, and they question whether they
            should not just author directly in HTML. As mentioned earlier
            in this document the TEI has many more elements than HTML. Long
            experience has taught us that it is much better to describe
            what something is, rather than what it looks like. Therefore,
            while in HTML encoding you might want to display in italics
            something that is a title, emphasized, a foreign phrase, or a
            specialized term. In HTML one might mark this as in italics,
            but in TEI one would mark this with elements for titles,
            emphasis, foreign phrases, or terms. The benefit of this is the
            easy ability to repurpose the material for different uses and
            also by separating out the presentation from the encoding it
            allows one to easily change the form of presentation for all
            similar elements at a later date. For example, changing all the
            titles to be underlined instead of in italics without worrying
            about accidentally changing emphasized text.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <head>What is your material like?</head>
        <p>One of the central reasons you choose not to use TEI is that
            there is an existing standard which suits your needs better.
            For example, if you are only encoding vector graphics then the
            Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) recommendation from the W3C is
            mostly likely a better choice. That said, if you are encoding
            documents which also contain vector graphics, then TEI would be
            a better choice as you can encode both the document and still
            embed the SVG inside it. This ability to be able to incorporate
            other standards as part of a TEI is one of its many strengths.
            Many other standards exist and the TEI has tried not to
            reinvent the wheel where a perfectly good one exists, instead
            allowing you to embed markup from other vocabularies in your
            TEI document where necessary. Additionally if the TEI does not
            cater for some textual phenomena important to your work, then
            it is possible to extend it (in an approved, documented, and
            conformant manner) to add new elements to deal with these.</p>
        <p>Another technology that people use frequently instead of the
            TEI, or other forms of XML, is relational databases. It makes
            sense to use a standard relational database when the nature of
            the data benefits from this form of storage and retrieval. One
            way to think about this division of information is whether it
            is data-like or document-like. Relational databases are good at
            storing single static fields where no markup is present in any
            of the fields. XML is good at deeply-nested, arbitrary, fields.
            An example might be an address and telephone list. If one is
            simply recording a flat list of names, phone numbers, and some
            address lines then a relational database is certainly
            sufficient. If the individual fields contain anything you want
            to record inside any of them then using a structured markup
            language like TEI XML is probably more suitable. So-called
            'document-like' information is often characterised by multiple
            levels of nesting of structures, for example divisions
            containing paragraphs containing various phrase-level markup
            such as names, abbreviations, or foreign phrases.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <head>What is your desired output?</head>
        <p>It is one of the basic ideas of descriptive markup that the
            presentation and output should be left as a separate step from
            the encoding of the information. Part of the reason for this is
            one is able to leverage the markup available in a TEI document
            to produce all sorts of outputs. (e.g. not only a rendering of
            a text, but indices of certain aspects, rearrangements or
            different views, and any number of statistics) The TEI provides
            basic customisable XSLT stylesheets for transforming TEI texts
            to HTML and PDF, and additionally there are ways to import and
            export TEI to/from word processors. One of the benefits of
            using XML as a format is that it is fairly easy to transform
            XML into other formats required for later software as tools
            exist to do this and transformation languages are fairly easy
            to learn. That said, if your output is to be created and
            accessed in the same format, or if it contains structures which
            are not able to be represented in TEI markup, then choosing
            another format may be more suitable. Likewise if the discipline
            you are working in has a significant number of tools and
            expertise available for a format commonly used in that
            discipline this may also be a factor in the format you
            choose.</p>

    <div>
        <head>Learning curves and technical support</head>
        <p>The competence of the person undertaking the encoding is
            necessarily a consideration in choosing technologies. However,
            it should be emphasized that a fairly good understanding of
            basic TEI XML can be obtained quite quickly in comparison to
            many of the other skills people learn in order to undertake
            similarly scholarly activity. Spending a few days learning TEI
            XML is an investment of time that is well worthwhile. That
            said, such an undertaking does presuppose a certain amount of
            basic computer literacy. It is worth remembering, that in some
            cases it may also be possible to outsource the required TEI
            encoding of your documents. One good reason for using the TEI,
            of course, is that there is a large international community who
            are willing to help you as you encounter new problems.
            Nonetheless, if the context in which you are undertaking the
            encoding (workplace, institution, etc.) provides no support for
            TEI or XML, and actively supports alternative solutions, then
            that should be borne in mind. What would be more beneficial, of
            course, is educate your colleagues as to the benefits of the
            TEI, and perhaps host a TEI Workshop with invited speakers to
            help train your local technical support. There are many
            scholars with basic computer literacy have been more than able
            to teach themselves the TEI.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <head>Intellectual versus practical benefits</head>
        <p>One of the many benefits of using the TEI is that you can
            intellectually specify textual distinctions that matter to you
            and are useful to your purposes. This is a lot more
            intellectually satisfying than only encoding for one platform,
            such as web distribution. And yet, if you have no experience
            with the TEI, and simply need to do a single web page very
            quickly, then deciding to learn the TEI, and investigating the
            various options for transformation to HTML, is probably not as
            practical. We would argue, of course, that learning TEI is
            never time spent poorly.</p>

    <div>
        <head>TEI and the history of digital text</head>
        <p>The TEI has a unique place in the history of the development of
            digital textual studies, digital humanities and the way we
            conceive of electronic text in a modern age. As a the TEI was
            originally a pre-web endeavour its decisions have helped to
            influence many of the people who have designed the systems,
            formats and processes which make up the web (including XML
            itself). If embarking on a text encoding project of any sort,
            it will do one no harm to examine the current TEI Guidelines.
            These guidelines are not a single publication of a small group
            of people, but they have been developed and updated over the
            last couple decades with input from countless scholars and
            experts from many fields. They have been revised again and
            again to introduce new concepts, expand older ones, and correct
            mistakes. This does not mean that there is not a long way to go
            in revising and improving the TEI Guidelines, simply that they
            have benefited from a long history of many eyes and experiences
            with all sorts of texts. The reason this should be important to
            you is that the Guidelines then provide a good resource of a
            codification of knowledge about the markup of various textual
            phenomena. It is quite likely that your problems and concerns
            are not unique and that others have encountered similar textual
            phenomena before you. After all, damage to the carving on a
            stone tablet is very similar, in a structural sense, to damage
            to a text in a medieval manuscript, or indeed a modern printed
            book rescued from a fire. </p>
        <p>While we sincerely believe that your journey is indeed worth it,
            it behoves us remind you that it may not strictly be necessary.
            It is a lot of fun though!</p>
