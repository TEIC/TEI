<head>Representation of Primary Sources</head>

<p>This chapter defines a module intended for use in the
representation of primary sources, such as manuscripts or other
written materials. Section <ptr target="#PHFAX"/> provides elements
for the encoding of digital facsimiles or images of such materials,
while the remainder of the chapter discusses ways of encoding detailed
transcriptions of such materials. It is expected that this module will
also be useful in the preparation of critical editions, but the module
defined here is distinct from that defined in chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>, and may be used independently of it. Detailed metadata
relating to primary sources of any kind may be recorded using the
elements defined by the manuscript description module discussed in
chapter <ptr target="#MS"/>, but again the present module may be used
independently if such data is not required.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that, as elsewhere in these Guidelines,  this
chapter places more emphasis on the problems of representing the
textual components of a document than on those relating to the
description of the document's physical characteristics such as the
carrier medium or physical construction. These aspects, of particular
importance in codicology and the bibliographic study of incunables,
are touched on in the chapter on Manuscript Description (<ptr target="#MS"/>) and also form the subject of ongoing work in the TEI
Physical Bibliography workgroup.</p>

<p>Although this chapter discusses manuscript materials more
frequently than other forms of written text, most of the
recommendations presented are equally applicable <foreign>mutatis
mutandis</foreign> in the encoding of printed matter or indeed any
form of written source, including monumental inscriptions. Similarly,
where in the following descriptions terms such as
<soCalled>scribe</soCalled>, <soCalled>author</soCalled>,
<soCalled>editor</soCalled>, <soCalled>annotator</soCalled> or
<soCalled>corrector</soCalled> are used, these may be re-interpreted
in terms more appropriate to the medium being transcribed. In printed
material, for example, the <soCalled>compositor</soCalled> plays a
role analogous to the <soCalled>scribe</soCalled>, while in an
authorial manuscript, the author and the scribe are the same person.
</p>

<div xml:id="PHFAX">
<head>Digital Facsimiles</head>

<p>These Guidelines are mostly concerned with the preparation of
digital texts, in which a pre-existing text is transcribed or
otherwise converted into character form, and marked up in
XML. However, it is also very common practice to make a different form
of <soCalled>digital text</soCalled>, which is instead composed of
digital images of the original source, typically one per page, or
other written surface. We call such a resource a <term>digital
facsimile</term>. A digital facsimile may, in the simplest case, just
consist of a collection of images, with some metadata to identify them
and the source materials portrayed. It may sometimes contain a
variety of images of the same source pages, for example of different
resolutions, or of different kinds. Such a collection may form part of
any kind of document, for example a commentary of a codicological or
paeleographic nature, where there is a need to align explanatory text
with image data. And it may also be complemented by
a transcribed or encoded version of the original source, which may be
linked to the page images. In this section we present elements
designed to support these various possibilities and discuss the
associated mechanisms provided by these Guidelines.</p>


<p>When this module is included in a schema, the class
<ident>att.global</ident> is extended to include a new pointer
attribute <att>facs</att>. This attribute may be used to associate any
element in a transcribed text with an image of it, by means of the
usual URI pointing mechanism. <!-- i.e. URI reference? --> </p>

<p>If a digital text contains one image per page or column (or similar
unit), and no more complex mapping between text and image is
envisaged, then the <att>facs</att> attribute may be used to point
directly to a graphic resource:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<TEI>
<teiHeader> <!--...--></teiHeader>
<text>
  <pb facs="page1.png"/>
    <!-- text contained on page 1 is encoded here -->
  <pb facs="page2.png"/>
    <!-- text contained on page 2 is encoded here -->
</text>
</TEI>  
</egXML>

By convention, this encoding indicates that the image indicated by
<att>facs</att> attribute represents the whole of the text following
the <gi>pb</gi> (pagebreak) element, up to the next <gi>pb</gi>
element. Any convenient milestone element (see further <ptr target="#CORS5"/>) could be used in the same
way; for example if the images represent individual columns, the
<gi>cb</gi> element might be used.  Though simple, this method has
some drawbacks. It does not scale well to more complex cases (where,
for example, the images do not correspond exactly with transcribed
pages, or where the intention is to align specific marked up elements
with detailed images, or parts of images. And it makes the management
of the information about the images more difficult by scattering
references to them through the file. Nevertheless, this solution may
be adequate for many straightforward <soCalled>digital
library</soCalled> applications. </p>

<p>The recommended approach to encoding facsimiles is instead to use
the <att>facs</att> attribute in conjunction with the elements
<gi>facsimile</gi>, <gi>surface</gi>, and <gi>zone</gi>, which are
also provided by this module. These elements make it possible to
accommodate multiple images of each page, as well as to record
arbitrary planar coordinates of textual elements on any kind of
written surface and to link such elements with digital facsimile
images of them. Typical applications include the provision of full
text search in <soCalled>digital facsimile editions</soCalled>, and
ways of annotating graphics, for example so as to identify individuals
appearing in a group portraits and link them to data about the person
represented. </p>

<p>The following elements are used to represent components of a
digital facsimile:
<specList>
<specDesc key="facsimile"/>
<specDesc key="surface" atts="start"/>
<specDesc key="zone"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>The <gi>facsimile</gi> element is used to represent a digital
facsimile. It appears within a TEI document along with, or instead of,
the <gi>text</gi> element introduced in section <ptr target="#DS"/>. When this module is selected therefore, a
legal TEI document may thus comprise any of the following:-
<list>
<item>a TEI Header and a text element</item>
<item>a TEI Header and a facsimile element</item>
<item>a TEI Header, a facsimile element, and a text element</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Like the <gi>text</gi> element, a <gi>facsimile</gi> element may
also contain an optional <gi>front</gi> or <gi>back</gi> element, used
in the same way as described in sections <ptr target="#DSFRONT"/> and
<ptr target="#DSBACK"/>. </p>
  
<p>In the simplest case, a facsimile just contains a series of
<gi>graphic</gi> elements, each of which identifies an image file:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<facsimile>
  <graphic url="page1.png"/>
  <graphic url="page2.png"/>
  <graphic url="page3.png"/>
  <graphic url="page4.png"/>
</facsimile>
</egXML>

If desired, the <gi>binaryObject</gi> element described in <ptr target="#COGR"/> (or any other element from the
<ident>model.graphicLike</ident> class) can be used instead of a
<gi>graphic</gi></p>

<p>In this simple case, the four page images are understood to
represent the complete facsimile, and are to be read in the sequence
given. Suppose, however, that the second page of this particular work
is available both as an ordinary photograph and as an infra-red image,
or in two different resolutions. The <gi>surface</gi> element may be
used to indicate that there are two image files corresponding with the
same area of the work:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<facsimile>
  <graphic url="page1.png"/>
  <surface>
   <graphic url="page2-highRes.png"/>
   <graphic url="page2-lowRes.png"/>
  </surface>
  <graphic url="page3.png"/>
  <graphic url="page4.png"/>
</facsimile>
</egXML>
</p>

<p>The <gi>surface</gi> element provides a way of indicating that the
two images of page2 represent the same physical surface within the
source material. A <term>surface</term> might be a sheet of paper or
parchment, a face of a monument, a billboard, a membrane of a scroll,
or indeed any two-dimensional surface, of any size. </p>

<p>The actual dimensions of the object represented are not documented
by the <gi>surface</gi> element; instead, the <gi>surface</gi> is
located within an abstract coordinate space, which is defined by the
following attributes, supplied by the <ident type="class">att.coordinated</ident> class:
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.coordinated" atts="ulx uly lrx lry"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p> The same coordinate space is used for a <gi>surface</gi> and for
all of its child elements. <note place="foot">The coordinate space
may be thought of as a grid superimposed on a rectangular
space. Rectangular areas of the grid are defined as four numbers <hi rend="math">a b c d</hi>: the first two identify the grid point which
is at the upper left corner of the rectangle; the second two give the
grid point located at the lower right corner of the rectangle. The
grid point <hi rend="math">a b</hi> is understood to be the point
which is located <hi rend="math">a</hi> points from the origin along
the <hi rend="math">x</hi> (horizontal) axis, and <hi rend="math">b</hi> points from the origin along the <hi rend="math">y</hi> (vertical) axis.</note>. It may be most convenient
to derive a coordinate space from a digital image of the surface in
question such that each pixel in the image corresponds with a whole
number of units (typically 1) in the coordinate space. In other cases
it may be more convenient to use units such as millimetres; in neither
case is any specific mapping to the physical dimensions of the object
represented implied.
</p>

<p>Each <gi>surface</gi> can contain one or more <gi>zone</gi>
elements, each of which represents a rectangular region or
<term>bounding box</term> defined in terms of the same coordinate
space as that of its parent <gi>surface</gi> element. This provides a
unit of analysis which may be used to define any rectangular region of
interest, such as a detail or illustration, or some part of the
surface which is to be aligned with a particular text element.  The
<ident type="class">att.coordinated</ident> attributes listed above
are also used to supply the coordinates of a zone. </p>
<p>As we have seen, a surface will usually correspond with the whole
of a written surface. A zone, by contrast, defines any arbitrary
rectangular area of interest using the same coordinate system. It
might be bigger or smaller than its parent surface, or might overlap
its boundaries. The only constraint is that it must be defined using
the same coordinate system. </p>

<p>When an image of some kind is supplied within either a zone or a
surface, the implication is that the whole of the image represents
the zone or surface containing it. In the simple case therefore, we
might imagine a surface defining a page, within which there is a
graphic representing the whole of that page, and a number of zones
defining parts of the page, each with its own graphic. If one of those
images actually represents an area larger than the page (for example
to include a binding or the surface of a
desk on which the page rests), then it might be enclosed by a zone
with coordinates smaller or larger than those of  the parent
surface. </p>

<p>Note that this mechanism does not provide any way of addressing a
non-rectangular area, nor of coping with distortions introduced by
perspective or parallax; if this is needed, the more powerful
mechanisms provided by the Standard Vector Graphics (SVG) language
should be used to define an overlay, as further discussed in <ptr target="#SACSXA"/>. </p>


<p>For example, consider the following figure: 
<figure><head>Relation
between page, surface, and zone</head> <graphic url="Images/facs-fig2.jpg"/></figure> This is an image of a two page
spread from a manuscript in the Badische Landesbibliothek,
Karlsruhe. We have no information as to the dimensions of the original object,
but the  low resolution image displayed here contains 500 pixels
horizontally and 321 pixels vertically. For convenience, we might map
each pixel to one cell of the coordinate space. 
<note place="foot">The coordinate space used here is based on pixels, but 
the mapping between pixels and units in the coordinate space 
need not be one-to-one; it might be convenient to
define a more delicate grid, to enable us to address much smaller
parts of the image. This can be done simply by supplying appropriate
values for the attributes which define the coordinate space; for
example doubling them all would map each pixel to two grid
points in the coordinate space.</note> </p>

<p>The coordinates of the <gi>surface</gi> (that is, the area of the
image which represents the written two page spread) can then be
specified in terms of this coordinate space, simply by counting
pixels in the image.  The left corner of the two page spread appears
50 units from the left of the image and 20 units from the top, while
the bottom right corner of the spread appears 400 units from the left
of the image, and 280 units from the top. We therefore define the
written surface within this image as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><facsimile>
<surface ulx="50" uly="20" lrx="400" lry="280">
	<!-- ... -->
</surface>
</facsimile></egXML> 
To introduce the image file itself, we will also need to define a zone
of interest which represents an area larger
than the surface. Using the same coordinate system as that defined
for the surface, its coordinates are <val>0,0,500,321</val>. This zone of interest is defined by a <gi>zone</gi>
element, within which we can place the uncropped <gi>graphic</gi>:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><facsimile>
<surface ulx="50" uly="20" lrx="400" lry="280">
<zone ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="500" lry="321">
<graphic url="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Handschrift.karlsruhe.blb.jpg"/>
</zone></surface>
</facsimile></egXML>
</p>

<p>If desired, the <gi>binaryObject</gi> element described in <ptr target="#COGR"/> (or any other element from the
<ident>model.graphicLike</ident> class) can be used instead of a
<gi>graphic</gi></p>

<p>The <gi>desc</gi> element may also be used within either
<gi>surface</gi> or <gi>zone</gi> to provide some further information
about the area being defined. For example, since the image in this
example contains two pages, it might be preferable to define
two distinct surfaces, one for each page, including its illuminated
margins. In this case, each surface must specify a bounding box which
encloses the appropriate page, as well as defining the zone for the
graphic itself:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><facsimile>

	<surface ulx="50" uly="20" lrx="210" lry="280">
	  <desc>left hand page</desc>
	  <zone ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="500" lry="321">
<graphic url="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Handschrift.karlsruhe.blb.jpg"/>
		</zone>
	</surface>
	<surface ulx="240" uly="25" lrx="400" lry="280">
	  <desc>right hand page</desc>
		<zone ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="500" lry="321">
			<graphic url="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Handschrift.karlsruhe.blb.jpg"/>
		</zone>
	</surface>
</facsimile></egXML>
</p>
<p>In addition to acting as a container for <gi>graphic</gi> elements,
<gi>zone</gi> elements may also be used to select
parts of each surface for analytical purposes. For
example, to define the written part of the left hand page:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><facsimile>
	<surface ulx="50" uly="20" lrx="210" lry="280">
	  <desc>Left hand page</desc>
		<zone ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="500" lry="321">
			<graphic url="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Handschrift.karlsruhe.blb.jpg"/>
		</zone>
		<zone ulx="90" uly="40" lrx="200" lry="225">
		  <desc>Written part of left hand page</desc>
		</zone>
	</surface>
</facsimile></egXML>
</p>


<p>In the following example, we discuss a hypothetical digital edition
of an early 16th century French work, Charles de Bovelles'
<title>Géometrie Pratique</title><note place="foot">The image is taken
from the collection at <ptr target="http://ancilla.unice.fr/Illustr.html"/>, and was digitized from a copy
in the Bibliothèque Municipale de Lyon, by whose kind permission it is
included here</note>. In this edition, each
page has been digitized as a separate file: for example, recto page 49
is stored in a file called <ident>Bovelles-49r.png</ident>.  In the
<gi>facsimile</gi> element used to contain the whole set of pages, we
define a <gi>surface</gi> element for this page, which we situate within a
coordinate scale running from 0 to 200 in the x (horizontal) axis,
and 0 to 300 in the y (vertical) axis.  The <gi>surface</gi> element
contains a <gi>graphic</gi> 
element which represents the whole of this surface: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><facsimile>
<surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">
  <graphic url="Bovelles-49r.png"/>
</surface>
</facsimile></egXML> We can now identify distinct zones within the
page image using the coordinate scale defined for the surface. In
<ptr target="#facs-fig1"/> we show the upper part of the page, with
boxes indicating four such zones. Each of these will be represented by
a  <gi>zone</gi> element, given within the <gi>surface</gi>
element already defined, and specified in terms of the same
coordinate system. 
<figure xml:id="facs-fig1">
  <head>Zones within a surface</head>
  <graphic url="Images/facs-fig1.png"/>
</figure>
The following encoding defines each of the four zones identified in
the figure.
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><facsimile>
<surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">
<graphic url="Bovelles-49r.png"/>
	<zone ulx="25" uly="25" lrx="180" lry="60"> 
	  <desc>contains the title</desc>
	</zone>
	<zone ulx="28" uly="75" lrx="175" lry="178"/> 
	<!-- contains the paragraph in italics -->
	<zone ulx="105" uly="76" lrx="175" lry="160"/> 
	<!-- contains the figure -->
	<zone ulx="45" uly="125" lrx="60" lry="130"/>
	<!-- contains the word "pendans" -->
</surface>
</facsimile></egXML> 
Note that the location of each zone is defined
independently but using the same coordinate system, so that they may
overlap freely. Zones need not  nest within each other; they must
however be rectangular, as previously noted. As noted earlier, a zone may
fall outside the area of the surface which defines its coordinate space.</p>

<p>In this example a single <gi>graphic</gi> element has been
associated directly with the surface of the page rather than nesting
it within a zone. However, it is also possible to include multiple
<gi>zone</gi> elements which contain a <gi>graphic</gi> element, if
for example a detailed image is available. Since all <gi>zone</gi>
elements use the same coordinate system (that defined by their parent
<gi>surface</gi>), there is no need to demonstrate enclosure of one
zone within another by means of nesting. To continue the current
example, supposing that we have an additional image called
<ident>Bovelles49r-detail.png</ident> containing an additional image
of the figure in the third zone above, we might encode that zone as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
  <zone ulx="105" uly="76" lrx="175" lry="160"> 
    <graphic url="Bovelles49r-detail.png"/>
  </zone>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Now suppose that we wish to align a transcription of this page
with the zones identified above. The first step is to give each
relevant part of the facsimile an identifier:
 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><facsimile>
<surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">
	<zone ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">
		<graphic url="Bovelles-49r.png"/>
	</zone>
	<zone ulx="105" uly="76" lrx="175" lry="160"> 
		<graphic url="Bovelles49r-detail.png"/>
	</zone>
	<zone xml:id="B49rHead" ulx="25" uly="25" lrx="180" lry="60"/> 
	<!-- contains the title -->
	<zone xml:id="B49rPara2" ulx="28" uly="75" lrx="175" lry="178"/> 
	<!-- contains the paragraph in italics -->
	<zone xml:id="B49rFig1" ulx="105" uly="76" lrx="175" lry="160"/> 
	<!-- contains the figure -->
	<zone xml:id="B49rW457" ulx="45" uly="125" lrx="60" lry="130"/>
	<!-- contains the word "pendans" -->
</surface>
</facsimile></egXML> 
The alignment between transcription and image is made, as usual, by
means of the <att>facs</att> attribute:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<pb facs="#B49r"/>
<fw>De Geometrie 49</fw>
<head facs="#B49rHead">

</div>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Further discussion of the principles underlying the encoding
choices made in the above transcription are provided in the remainder
of this chapter. </p>

<p>It is also possible to point in the other direction, from a
<gi>surface</gi> or <gi>zone</gi> to the corresponding text. This is
the function of the <att>start</att> attribute, which supplies the
identifier of the element containing the transcribed text found within
the surface or zone concerned. Thus, another way of linking this page
with its transcription would be simply <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><facsimile>
<surface start="#PB49R">

<div xml:id="PHST"><head>Scope of Transcriptions</head>

<p>When transcribing a primary source, scholars may wish to record
information concerning individual readings of letters, words, or larger
units, whether the object is simply a <soCalled>neutral</soCalled>
transcription or a critical edition.  In either case they  may also
wish to include other editorial material, such
as comments on the status or possible origin of particular readings,
corrections, or text supplied to fill lacunae.  Further, it is
customary in transcriptions to register certain features of the
source, such as ornamentation, underlining, deletion, areas of damage
and lacunae. This chapter provides ways of encoding such information:
<list type="bullets">
<item>first, methods of recording editorial or other alterations to
the text, such as expansion of abbreviations, corrections, conjectures,
etc. (section <ptr target="#PHCH"/>)</item>
<item>then, methods of describing important extra-linguistic phenomena
in the source: unusual spaces, lines, page and line breaks, change of
manuscript hand, etc. (section <ptr target="#PHPH"/>)</item>
<item>finally, a method of recording material such as running heads,
catch-words, and the like (section <ptr target="#PHSK"/>)</item></list></p>
<p>These recommendations are not intended to meet every
transcriptional circumstance likely to be faced by any scholar.
Rather, they should be regarded as a base which can be elaborated if necessary by different scholars in different disciplines<!-- , with
distinct scholarly domains eventually developing their own document
types.  In time, the feature structure notation developed in chapter
<ptr target="#FS"/>, may also permit scholars to tailor the encoding
of complex transcriptional information in ways not here anticipated-->.
 <!-- We are conscious that a great deal of work remains to done in
these areas, and that the encoder will need to take even more
individual responsibility than usual in applying the recommendations
of this chapter in such contexts, but believe that these
recommendations form a good basis for such future work.-->
</p><p>As a rule, all elements which may be used in the course of a
transcription of a single witness may also be used in a critical
apparatus, i.e. within the elements proposed in chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>.
This can generally be achieved by nesting a
particular reading containing tagged elements from a particular witness
within the <gi>rdg</gi> element in an <gi>app</gi> structure.
	</p>
<p>Just as a critical apparatus may contain transcriptional elements
within its record of variant readings in various witnesses, one may
record variant readings in an individual witness by use of the apparatus
mechanisms <gi>app</gi> and <gi>rdg</gi>.  This is discussed in
section <ptr target="#TCTR"/>.
	</p>
</div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="PHCH"><head>Altered, Corrected, and Erroneous Texts</head>
<p>In the detailed transcription of any source, it may prove necessary
to record various types of actual or potential alteration of the text:
expansion of abbreviations, correction of the text (either by author,
scribe, or later hand, or by previous or current editors or scholars),
addition, deletion, or substitution of material, and the like.  The
sections below describe how such phenomena may be encoded using either
elements defined in the core module (defined in chapter <ptr target="#CO"/>) or specialized elements available only when the module
described in this chapter is available.</p>
<!-- add and del for things added and removed
     supplied by later editor  (add suppress, or use gap) -> ed for
     emendation in general (DO, MD, LB to discuss) -->

<div type="div3" xml:id="PHCO">
<head>Core elements for Transcriptional Work</head>
<p>In transcribing individual sources 
of any type, encoders may record corrections, normalizations,
expansions of abbreviations, additions, and omissions
using the elements described in section <ptr target="#COED"/>.
Those particularly relevant to this chapter include:

<specDesc key="add"/>
<specDesc key="choice"/>
<specDesc key="corr"/>
<specDesc key="del"/>
<specDesc key="expan"/>
<specDesc key="gap"/>
<specDesc key="sic"/>
</specList>
	</p>
<p>Several of these elements bear additional attributes for specifying who
is responsible for the  interpretation represented by the markup,
and the certainty associated with it. In addition, some
of them bear an attribute allowing the markup to be categorised by
type and source. 
<specList><specDesc key="att.editLike" atts="cert resp source"/>
    <specDesc key="att.typed" atts="type subtype"/>
</specList>
The specific aspect of the markup described by these attributes differs
on different elements; for further discussion, see the relevant sections
below, especially section <ptr target="#PHHR"/>.</p>
<p>The following sections describe how the core elements just named may
be used in the transcription of primary source materials. </p></div>

<div type="div3" xml:id="PHAB"><head>Abbreviation and Expansion</head>

<p>The writing of manuscripts by hand lends itself to the use of
abbreviation to shorten scribal labour. Commonly occurring letters,
groups of letters, words, or even whole phrases, may be represented by
significant marks. This phenomenon of manuscript abbreviation is so
widespread and so various that no taxonomy of it is here attempted.
Instead, methods are shown which allow abbreviations to be encoded using
the core elements mentioned above.</p>
<p>A manuscript abbreviation may be viewed in two ways. One may
transcribe it as a particular sequence of letters or marks upon the
page: thus, a <q>p with a bar through the descender</q>, a
<q>superscript hook</q>, a <q>macron</q>. One may also interpret the
abbreviation in terms of the letter or letters it is seen as standing
for: thus, <q>per</q>, <q>re</q>, <q>n</q>. Both of these views are
supported by these Guidelines. </p>
<p>In many cases the glyph found in the manuscript source also exists
in the Unicode character set: for example the common Latin brevigraph
⁊, standing for <mentioned>et</mentioned> and often known as
the <soCalled>Tironian et</soCalled> can be directly represented in
any XML document as the Unicode character with code point
<val>x204A</val> (see further <ptr target="#SG-er"/> and <ptr target="#CHSH"/>). In cases where it does not, these Guidelines
recommend use of the <gi>g</gi> element provided by the <ident type="module">gaiji</ident> module described in chapter <ptr target="#WD"/>. This module allows the encoder great flexibility both
in processing and in documenting non-standard characters or glyphs,
including the ability to provide detailed documentation and images for
them.
</p>
<p>These two methods of coding abbreviation may also be combined. An
encoder may record, for any abbreviation, both the sequence of letters
or marks which constitutes it, and its sense, that is, the letter or
letters for which it is believed to stand. For example, in the
following fragment<note place="foot">From <ptr type="cit" target="#PH-BIBL-1"/>.</note>, the phrase <mentioned>euery persone</mentioned>
is represented by a sequence of characters which may be transcribed
directly, using the <gi>g</gi> element to indicate the two brevigraphs
it contains as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">eu<g ref="#er"/>y <g ref="#per"/>sone that loketh after heuen hath a place in this
ladder</egXML> The transcriber may also wish to indicate that, because
of the
presence of these 
particular characters, the two words are actually abbreviations, by using the <gi>abbr</gi>
element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><abbr>eu<g ref="#er"/>y</abbr> <abbr><g ref="#per"/>sone</abbr> ... </egXML>
Alternatively, the transcriber may choose silently to expand these
abbreviations, using the <gi>expan</gi> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>euery</expan>
<expan>persone</expan> ... </egXML> And, of course, the
<gi>choice</gi> element can be used to show that one encoding is an
alternaative for the other:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><choice><abbr>eu<g ref="#er"/>y</abbr><expan>euery</expan></choice></egXML>
</p>
<p>When abbreviated forms such as these are expanded, two processes
are carried out: some characters not present in the abbreviation are
added (always), and some characters or glyphs present in the
abbreviation are omitted or replaced (often). For example, when the
abbreviation <mentioned>Dr.</mentioned> is expanded to
<mentioned>Doctor</mentioned>, the dot in the abbreviation is removed,
and the letters <mentioned>octo</mentioned> are added. 
Where detailed markup of abbreviated
words is required, these two aspects may be marked up explicitly,
using the following elements:
<specList>
<specDesc key="ex"/>
<specDesc key="am"/>
</specList>
Using these elements,
a transcriber may indicate the status of the individual letters or signs within both the abbreviation and the
expansion. The <gi>am</gi> element surrounds characters or signs such
as tittles or tildes, used to indicate the presence of an
abbreviation, which are typically removed or replaced by other
characters  in
the expanded form of the abbreviation:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><abbr>eu<am><g ref="#er"/></am>y</abbr> <abbr><am><g ref="#per"/></am>sone</abbr> ... </egXML>
while the <gi>ex</gi> element may be used to indicate those characters
within the expansion which are not present in the abbreviated
form. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>eu<ex>er</ex>y</expan>
<expan><ex>per</ex>sone</expan> ... </egXML> 
The content of the <gi>abbr</gi> element should usually include the
whole of the abbreviated word, while the <gi>expan</gi> element should
include the whole of its expansion. If this is not considered
necessary, the <gi>am</gi> and <gi>ex</gi> elements may be used within
a <gi>choice</gi> element,
as in this example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">eu<choice><am><g ref="#er"/></am><ex>er</ex></choice>y 
<choice><am><g ref="#per"/></am><ex>per</ex></choice>sone ... </egXML> 
</p>
<p>As implied in the preceding discussion, making decisions about
which of these various methods of representing abbreviation to use
will form an important part of an encoder's practice. As a rule, the
<gi>abbr</gi> and <gi>am</gi> elements should be preferred where it is wished to
signify that the content of the element is an abbreviation, without
necessarily indicating what the abbreviation may stand for. The
<gi>ex</gi> and <gi>expan</gi> elements should be used where it is wished to signify that
the content of the element is not present in the source but has been
supplied by the transcriber, without necessarily indicating the
abbreviation used in the original. The decision as to which course of
action is appropriate may vary from abbreviation to abbreviation;
there is no requirement that the one system be used throughout a
transcription, although doing so will generally simplify
processing. The choice is likely to be a matter of editorial policy.
If the highest priority is to transcribe the text literatim, while
indicating the presence of abbreviations, the choice will be to use
<gi>abbr</gi> or <gi>am</gi> throughout. If the highest priority is to present a
reading transcription, while indicating that some letters or words are
not actually present in the original, the choice will be to use
<gi>ex</gi> or <gi>expan</gi>
throughout.</p>
<p>Further information may be attached to instances of these elements by
the <gi>note</gi> element, on which see section <ptr target="#CONO"/>, and
by use of the <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att> attributes. In this
instance from the English <title>Brut</title>,<note place="foot">On fol
65v of Bodleian MS. Rawlinson Poetry 32; in Parkes 12(ii).</note>
a note is attached to an editorial expansion of the tail on the final d
of <mentioned>good</mentioned> to <mentioned>goode</mentioned>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">For alle the while that I had
good<ex xml:id="exp01">e</ex>
I was welbeloued</egXML>
 <!--  abbr="&#x027d;" -->
Then the note: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><note target="#exp01">The stroke added to the final d could signify the
plural ending (-es, -is, -ys&gt;) but the singular <hi rend="it">good</hi> was used with the meaning <q>property</q>,
<q>wealth</q>, at this time (v. examples quoted in OED, sb. Good,
C. 7, b, c, d and 8 spec.)</note></egXML> The editor might declare a
degree of certainty for this expansion, based on the OED examples, and
state the responsibility for the expansion: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">For alle the while that I had
good<ex resp="#mp" cert="high">e</ex> I was welbeloued</egXML> The
value supplied for the <att>resp</att> attribute should point to the
name of the editor responsible for this and possibly other
interventions; an appropriate element therefore might be a
<gi>respStmt</gi> element in the header like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<respStmt xml:id="mp">
<resp>Editorial emendations</resp>
<name>Malcom Parkes</name>
</respStmt></egXML>
Observe that the <att>cert</att> and <att>resp</att> attributes are
used with the <gi>ex</gi> element only to indicate
confidence in the content of the element (i.e. the expansion), and
responsibility for suggesting this expansion  respectively. </p>
<p>The <gi>choice</gi> element may be used to indicate that the
proposed expansion is one way of encoding what might equally well be
represented as an abbreviation, represented by the hooked D, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">For alle the while that I had
<choice><sic>good<abbr>ɽ</abbr></sic>
<expan resp="#mp" cert="high">good<ex>e</ex></expan></choice>
I was welbeloued</egXML>
If it is desired to express aspects of certainty and responsibility
for some other aspect of the use of these elements, then the
mechanisms discussed in chapter <ptr target="#CE"/> should be
used. See also <ptr target="#PHHR"/> for discussion of the issues of
certainty and responsibility in the context of transcription.</p>

<p>If more than one expansion for the same abbreviation is to be
recorded, multiple notes may be supplied. It may also be appropriate
to use the markup for critical apparatus; an example is given in
section <ptr target="#TCTR"/>.</p>
</div>


<div type="div3" xml:id="PHCC"><head>Correction and Conjecture</head>

<p>The <gi>sic</gi>, <gi>corr</gi>, and <gi>choice</gi> elements,
defined in the <ident type="module">core</ident> module should be used to
indicate passages deemed in need of correction, or actually corrected,
during the  transcription of a source. For
example, in the manuscript of William James's <title>A Pluralistic
Universe</title>, edited by Fredson Bowers (Cambridge: Harvard
University Press, 1977) a sentence first written <q rend="display">One
must have lived longer with this system, to appreciate its
advantages.</q> has been modified by James to begin <q>But One must
...</q>, without the inital capital O having been reduced to
lowercase. This non-standard orthography could be recorded thus:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">But <sic>One</sic>
must have lived ...</egXML> or corrected: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">But <corr>one</corr> must
have lived ...</egXML> or the two possibilities might be represented
as a choice: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">But
<choice><sic>One</sic><corr>one</corr></choice> must have lived
...</egXML></p>
<p>Similarly, in this example from Albertus Magnus,<note place="foot"><title>De
Nutrimento et Nutribili, Tractatus 1</title>, fol 217r col b of Merton
College Oxford MS O.2.1 (Parkes pl. 16).</note>
both a manuscript error <mentioned>angues</mentioned> and its correction
<mentioned>augens</mentioned> are registered within a  <gi>choice</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Nos autem iam ostendimus quod nutrimentum
et <choice><sic>angues</sic><corr>augens</corr></choice>.</egXML>
</p> 
<p>Note that the <gi>corr</gi> element is used to provide a corrected
form which is <emph>not</emph> present in the source; in the case of a
correction made in the source itself, whether scribal, authorial, or
by some other hand, the <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi>,
and <gi>subst</gi> elements described in <ptr target="#PHAD"/> should be
used.</p>
<p>The <gi>sic</gi> element is used to mark passages considered by the
transcriber to be erroneous; in such cases, the <gi>corr</gi> element
indicates the transcriber's correction of them. Where the transcriber
considers that one or more words have been erroneously omitted in the
original source and corrects this omission, the <gi>supplied</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#PHOM"/> should be used in preference to <gi>corr</gi>. Thus,
in the following example, from George Moore's draft of additional materials for
<title>Memoirs of My Dead Life</title>,<note place="foot">In Pierpont Morgan MA
  3421, from <title>British Literary Manuscripts/Series II:  from 1800
  to 1914</title>, by V. Klinkenborg, H.Cahoon and C. Ryskamp (New York:
  Pierpont Morgan Library, 1981).</note>
the transcriber supplies the word <mentioned>we</mentioned> omitted by the author:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">You see that I avoid the word create for we
create nothing <supplied>we</supplied> develope.</egXML>
</p>
<p>As with <gi>expan</gi> and <gi>abbr</gi>, the
choice as to whether to record simply that there is an apparent error,
or simply that a correction has been applied, or to record both
possible readings within a  <gi>choice</gi> element is
left to the encoder. The decision is likely to be a matter of editorial policy,
which might be applied consistently throughout or decided case by case.
If the highest priority is to present an uncorrected transcription while
noting perceived errors in the original, the choice will typically
be to use only <gi>sic</gi> throughout. If the highest priority is to
present a reading transcription, while indicating that perceived errors
in the original have been corrected, the choice will be to use
only <gi>corr</gi> throughout.</p>

<p>Further information may be attached to instances of these elements by
the <gi>note</gi> element and <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att>
attributes. Instances of these elements may also be classified
according to any convenient typology using the <att>type</att>
attribute. </p>
<p>For example, consider the following encoding of an
emendation in the  Hengwrt manuscript proposed by  E. Talbot
Donaldson: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Telle me also, to what conclusioun
Were membres maad, of generacioun
And of so parfit wis a 
<choice xml:id="corr117"><sic>wight</sic><corr>wright</corr></choice>
ywroght?
<!-- ... -->
<note target="#corr117">This emendation of the Hengwrt copy text,
based on a Latin source and on the reading of three late
and usually unauthoritative manuscripts, was proposed
by E. Talbot Donaldson in <bibl><title>Speculum</title> 40 (1965)
626–33.</bibl></note>
</egXML>
The <gi>note</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#CONO"/> may be
used to give a more detailed discussion of the motivation for or scope
of a correction. If linked by means of a pointer (as in this example)
it may be located anywhere convenient within the transcription;
typically all detailed notes will be collected together in a separate
<gi>div</gi> element in the <gi>back</gi>. Alternatively, the pointer
may be omitted, and the <gi>note</gi> placed immediately adjacent to
the element being annotated. The advantage of the former solution  is
that it permits the same annotation to refer to several corrections. </p>
<p>The attribute <att>cert</att> may be used to indicate the
degree of confidence ascribed by the encoder to the proposed
emendation on a broad scale: high, medium, or low. The attribute
<att>resp</att> is used to indicate who is responsible for the
proposed emendation. Its value is a pointer, which will typically
indicate a <gi>respStmt</gi> or <gi>name</gi> element in the header of the transcribed
document, but can point anywhere, for example to some online authority
file. Using these two attributes, we the <gi>corr</gi> element
presented above might usefully be enhanced as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<!-- somewhere in the header ... --> 
<name xml:id="ETD">E Talbot Donaldson</name> 
<!-- ... -->
And of so parfit wis a 
<choice><sic>wight</sic><corr resp="#ETD" cert="medium">wright</corr></choice>
ywroght?
</egXML></p>

<p>As remarked above, where the same annotation applies to several
corrections, this may be represented by supplying multiple pointers on the
note. Consider for example such
corrections as the following, in Dudo of S. Quentin<note place="foot"><title>De moribus et actis primorum Normannie
ducum</title>, fol 4v of British Library MS Harley 3742, Parkes pl
6(i).</note>. Parkes cites two cases in this manuscript of the same
phenomenon: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">quamuis <choice xml:id="sic-1"><sic>mens</sic><corr>iners</corr></choice> que nutu dei
gesta sunt ... unde esset uiriliter <choice xml:id="sic-2"><corr>uegetata</corr><sic>negata</sic></choice></egXML>
which may be described as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><note target="#sic-1 #sic-2">Substitution of a more familiar word which resembles
graphically what the scribe should be copying but which does not make
sense in the context.</note></egXML>
</p>
<p>The <att>target</att> attribute on the <gi>note</gi> element
indicates the <gi>choice</gi> elements which exemplify this kind of
scribal error. This necessitates the addition of an identifier to each
<gi>choice</gi> element. However, if the number of corrections is large
and the number of notes is small, it may well be both more practical
and  more appropriate to
regard the collection of annotations as constituting a typology and
then use the <att>type</att> attribute. Suppose that the note given
above is one of half a dozen possible kinds of corrected phenomena
identified in a given text; others might include, say, <q>repetition
of a word from the preceding line</q>, etc. The <att>type</att>
attribute on the <gi>corr</gi> element can be used to specify an
arbitrary code for the particular kind of correction (or other
editorial intervention) identified within it. This code can be chosen
freely and is not treated as a pointer. 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">quamuis
<choice><sic>mens</sic><corr type="graphSubs">iners</corr></choice> que nutu dei
gesta sunt ... unde esset uiriliter <choice><corr type="graphSubs">uegetata</corr><sic>negata</sic></choice></egXML>
Note that this encoding might be extended to include a range of
possible corrections:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">quamuis
<choice><sic>mens</sic><corr type="graphSubs">iners</corr><corr type="reversal">inres</corr></choice> que nutu dei
gesta sunt ...</egXML>
In addition, the conscientious encoder will provide documentation
explaining the circumstances in which particular codes are judged
appropriate. A suitable location for this might be within the
<gi>correction</gi> element of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> of the
header, which might include a <gi>list</gi> such as the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<correction>
<p>The following codes are used to categorise corrections identified
in this transcription:
<list type="gloss">
<label>graphSubs</label>
<item>Substitution of a more familiar word which resembles
graphically what the scribe should be copying but which does not make
sense in the context.</item>
<!-- ... -->
</list></p></correction></egXML>
A <att>subtype</att> attribute may be used in conjunction with the
<att>type</att> for subclassification purposes: the above examples
might thus be represented as <gi>choice type="substitution"
subtype="graphicResemblence"</gi> for example. </p>
<p>For a given project, it may well be desirable to limit the possible
values for the <att>type</att> or <gi>subtype</gi> attributes automatically. This is easily
done but requires customization of the TEI system using techniques
described in <ptr target="#MD"/>, in particular <ptr target="#MDMDAL"/>, which should be consulted for further information
on this topic.</p>
<p>When making a correction in a source which forms part of a textual
tradition attested by many witnesses, a textual editor will
sometimes use a reading from one witness to correct the reading of the
source text. In the general case, such encoding is best achieved with  the
mechanisms provided by the module for textual criticism described in
chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>. However, for simple cases, the
<att>source</att> attribute of the <gi>corr</gi> attribute may
suffice. In the passage from Chaucer's
<title>Wife of Bath's Tale</title> mentioned above, Parkes proposes to
emend the problematic word <mentioned>wight</mentioned> to
<mentioned>wyf</mentioned> which is the reading found in the Cambridge
manuscript Gg.1. 27. This may be simply represented as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
And of so parfit wis a 
<choice><sic>wight</sic><corr resp="#mp" source="#Gg">wyf</corr></choice>
ywroght?</egXML>
The value of the <att>source</att> attribute here is, like the value
of the <att>resp</att> attribute, a pointer, in this case indicating
the manuscript used as a witness. Elsewhere in the transcribed text, a
list of witnesses used in this text will be given, one of which has an
identifier <code>Gg</code>. Each witness will be represented either by
a <gi>witness</gi> element (see <ptr target="#TCAPLL"/>) or more fully
by a <gi>msDesc</gi> element (see <ptr target="#MS"/>) :
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msDesc xml:id="Gg">
      <msIdentifier>
        <settlement>Cambridge</settlement>
        <repository>University Library</repository>
        <idno>Gg.1. 27</idno>
      </msIdentifier>
<!-- further description of the manuscript here -->
</msDesc></egXML>
</p>

<p>The <gi>app</gi> element described in chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>
provides a more powerful way of representing all three possible
readings in parallel: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">And of so
parfit wis a
<app>
  <rdg wit="#Hg">wight</rdg>
  <rdg wit="#Ln #Ry2 #Ld">wright</rdg>
  <rdg wit="#Gg">wyf</rdg>
</app></egXML></p>
<p>This encoding simply records the three readings found in the
various traditions, and gives (by means of the <att>wit</att>
attribute) an indication of the witnesses supporting each. If the
<att>resp</att> attribute were supplied on the <gi>rdg</gi> element,
it would indicate the person responsible for asserting that the
manuscript indicated has this reading, who is not necessarily the same
as the person responsible for asserting that this reading should
be used to correct the others. Editorial intervention elements such as
<gi>corr</gi> can however be nested within a <gi>rdg</gi> to provide
this additional information:

 <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">And of so
parfit wis a
<app>
  <rdg wit="#Hg">wight</rdg>
  <rdg wit="#Ln #Ry2 #Ld"><corr resp="#ETD">wright</corr></rdg>
  <rdg wit="#Gg"><corr resp="mp">wyf</corr></rdg>
</app></egXML>

This encoding asserts that the reading <mentioned>wyf</mentioned>
found in Gg is regarded as a correction by Parkes. </p>

<p>Like the <att>resp</att> attribute, the <att>cert</att> attribute
may be used with both <gi>corr</gi> and <gi>rdg</gi> elements. When
used on the <gi>rdg</gi> element, these attributes indicate confidence
in and responsibility for identifying the reading within the sources
specified; when used on the <gi>corr</gi> element they indicate
confidence in and responsibility for the use of the reading to correct
the base text. If no other source is indicated (either by the
<att>source</att> attribute, or by the <att>wit</att> attribute of a
parent <gi>rdg</gi>), the reading supplied within a <gi>corr</gi> has
been provided by the person indicated by the <att>resp</att>
attribute.
</p>

<p>If it is desired to express aspects of certainty and responsibility
for some other aspect of the use of these elements, then the
mechanisms discussed in chapter <ptr target="#CE"/> may be found
useful. See also <ptr target="#PHHR"/> for further discussion of the
issues of certainty and responsibility in the context of
transcription.</p></div>

<div type="div3" xml:id="PHAD"><head>Additions and Deletions</head>

<p>Additions and deletions observed in a source text may be described
using the following elements:
<specList>
  <specDesc key="add"/>
  <specDesc key="addSpan"/>
  <specDesc key="del"/>
  <specDesc key="delSpan"/>
</specList>
Of these, <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi> are included in the core
module, while <gi>addSpan</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi> are available only
when using the module defined in this chapter. These particular elements
are members of the <ident type="class">att.spanning</ident> class,
from which they inherit the following attribute:
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.spanning" atts="spanTo"/>
</specList>

</p>

<p>Further characteristics of each addition and deletion, such as the
hand used, its effect (complete or incomplete, for example), or its
position in a sequence of such operations may conveniently be recorded
as attributes of these elements, all of which are members of the
<ident type="class">att.transcriptional</ident> class:
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.transcriptional" atts="seq status hand"/>
</specList>
</p>


<p>As described in section <ptr target="#COED"/>, the <gi>add</gi>
element is used to record any manuscript addition observed in the
text, whether it is considered to be authorial or scribal. In the
autograph manuscript of Max Beerbohm's <title>The Golden
Drugget</title>,<note place="foot">In Pierpont Morgan MA 3391
(Klinkenborg 123).</note> the author's addition of <mentioned>do
ever</mentioned> may be recorded as follows, with the <att>hand</att>
attribute indicating that the addition was Beerbohm's by referencing a
<gi>handNote</gi> element defined elsewhere in the document (see
further <ptr target="#PHDH"/>): 

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Some things are best at first
sight. Others — and here is one of them — <add hand="#mb">do
ever</add> improve by recognition ....
<handNote xml:id="mb">Max Beerbohm holograph</handNote>
</egXML>
</p>

<p>Similarly, when the <gi>del</gi> element is used to
record manuscript deletions. In the autograph manuscript of D.
H. Lawrence's <title>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani</title><note place="foot">In Pierpont Morgan MA 1892, (Klinkenborg 129).</note>,
the author's deletion of <mentioned>my</mentioned> may be recorded as
follows. In this case, the <att>hand</att> attribute indicating that
the deletion was Lawrence's is complemented by a <att>rend</att>
attribute indicating that the deletion was by strike-through: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">For I hate this <del rend="strikethrough" hand="#dhl">my</del> body, which is so dear to me
...
<handNote xml:id="dhl">D H Lawrence holograph</handNote>

</egXML></p>


<p>If deletions are classified systematically, the <att>type</att>
attribute may be useful to indicate the classification; when they are
classified by the manner in which they were effected, or by their
appearance, however, this will lead to a certain arbitrariness in
deciding whether to use the <att>type</att> or the <att>rend</att>
attribute to hold the information. In general, it is recommended that
the <att>rend</att> attribute be used for description of the
appearance or method of deletion, and that the <att>type</att>
attribute be reserved for higher level or more abstract
classifications.</p>

<p>The <att>place</att> attribute is also available to indicate the
location of an addition. For example, in the following line from the typescript of Eliot's
<title>The Waste Land</title><note place="foot">This and the following
example are reproduced from
<title>The Waste Land. a facsimile and transcript</title>  edited by Valerie Eliot. Faber, 1971. p.9</note>, the word
<mentioned>foe</mentioned> is crossed out, and the word
<mentioned>friend</mentioned> is written in the right margin,
together with an insertion mark. <figure>
<graphic url="Images/PHfigEliot-1.png" width="600px"/></figure>
This line might be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
"Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's <del>foe</del> to men, 
<add place="margin">friend</add></egXML>
The deletion and the addition in this example are in the same hand,
presumably Eliot's. Other deletions in the typescript are in different
hands and done in different ways: for example, at the start of the same
passage: <figure><graphic url="Images/PHfigEliot-2.png" width="600px"/></figure>
The first two lines of this passage might be
encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<l><add place="above">Unreal</add><del rend="overtyped">Terrible</del> City<del resp="#EP">,</del> I have sometimes seen
and see</l>
<l>Under the brown fog of <del resp="#EP" rend="box">your</del> winter
dawn...</l></egXML>
The typescript originally read <q>Terrible City</q>: the first word
was then overtyped with xs to delete it, and the word
<mentioned>Unreal</mentioned> typed above the deletion. Two further
deletions here are attributed to Pound (EP): the comma following
<mentioned>City</mentioned>, and the word <mentioned>your</mentioned>;
the latter deletion being marked by a box drawn around it rather than by
a line through it. </p>
<p>An encoder may also wish to indicate that an addition replaces a
specific deletion, that is to encode a substitution as a single
intervention in the text. This may be achieved by grouping the
addition and deletion together within a <gi>subst</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
"Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's 
<subst><del>foe</del><add place="margin">friend</add></subst> to men, 
</egXML>
The use of this element, and the use of the <att>seq</att> attribute to indicate the
order in which interventions such as deletions are believed to have
occurred, are  further discussed in section <ptr target="#PHSU"/> below.
</p>

<p>The <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi> elements defined in the core module
suffice only for the description of additions and deletions which fit
within the structure of the text being transcribed, that is, which
each deletion or addition is completely contained by the structural
element (paragraph, line, division) within which it occurs. Where this
is not the case, for example because an individual addition or deletion
involves  several
distinct structural subdivisions, such as poems or prose items, or
otherwise
crosses a structural boundary in the text being encoded, special
treatment is needed. The <gi>addSpan</gi> and
<gi>delSpan</gi> elements are provided by this  module for that
purpose. (For a general discussion of the issue see further <ptr target="#NH"/>).</p>

<p>In this example of the use of <gi>addSpan</gi>, the
insertion of a gathering containing four neo-Eddic poems into
<title>Landsbókasafn</title><note place="foot">In Reykjavík, Lbs 1562 4to</note> by Helgi
Ólafsson is recorded as follows.  
<!-- added clarificatory sentence -->
A <gi>handNote</gi> element is first declared, within the header of the
document, to associate the identifier <val>heol</val> with Helgi. Each
of the added poems is encoded as a distinct <gi>div</gi> element. In
the body of the text, an <gi>addSpan</gi> element is placed to mark
the beginning of the span of added text, and an <gi>anchor</gi> is
used to mark its end.  The <att>hand</att> attribute on the
<gi>addSpan</gi> element ascribes responsibility for the addition to
the manuscript to Helgi, and the <att>spanTo</att> attribute points to
the end of the added text:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><handNote xml:id="heol" scribe="HelgiÓlafsson"/>
<!-- ... -->
<body>
<div><!-- text here --></div>
<addSpan n="added gathering" hand="#heol" spanTo="#p025"/>
<div><!-- text of first added poem here --></div>
<div><!-- text of second added poem here --></div>
<div><!-- text of third added poem here --></div>
<div><!-- text of fourth added poem here --></div>
<anchor xml:id="p025"/>
<div><!-- more text here --></div></body>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>delSpan</gi> element is used in the same way. For example,
in the Eliot typescript mentioned above, there are several occasions
where sequences of whole lines are marked for deletion, either by boxes or by being
struck out. If the encoder is marking up individual verse lines with
the <gi>l</gi> element, such deletions are problematic: deletion of
two consecutive lines should be regarded as a single deletion, but the
<gi>del</gi> element must be properly nested within a single
<gi>l</gi> element. The <gi>delSpan</gi> element solves this problem:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<l>Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,</l>
<delSpan spanTo="#EPdelEnd" resp="#EP" rend="strikethrough"/>
<l>To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the time,</l>
<l>With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.</l>
<anchor xml:id="EPdelEnd"/>
<l>There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying "Stetson!</l>...
</egXML>
</p>
<p>It is often the case that deletions and additions may themselves contain other
deletions and additions. For example, in
 Thomas Moore's autograph of the second version of
<title>Lalla Rookh</title><note place="foot">In Pierpont Morgan MA 310,
(Klinkenborg 23).</note> two lines are marked for omission by vertical
strike-through. Within the first of the two lines, the word
<mentioned>upon</mentioned> has also been struck out, and the word
<mentioned>over</mentioned> has been added: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>
   <delSpan rend="verticalStrike" spanTo="#delend01"/>
   Tis moonlight <del>upon</del> <add>over</add> Oman's sky</l>
<l>Her isles of pearl look lovelily<anchor xml:id="delend01"/></l></egXML>
In this case the <gi>anchor</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi> have been
placed within the structural elements (the <gi>l</gi>s) rather than
between, as in the previous example. This is to indicate that
placement of these empty elements is arbitrary.  </p>
<p>The text deleted must be at least partially legible, in order for
the encoder to be able to transcribe it.  If it is not legible at all,
the <gi>gap</gi> element should be used to signal that the text was
not transcribed, because it could not be; the <att>reason</att>
attribute can give the cause of the omission from the transcription as
<q>deletion, illegible</q>.  <!-- The <gi>gap</gi> element may optionally
be enclosed by a <gi>del</gi> element, if it is thought useful to
record the deletion explicitly using this element.-->  If the deleted
text is partially legible, the <gi>unclear</gi> element described in
section <ptr target="#PHDA"/> may be used to indicate areas of
text which cannot be read with confidence. See further section <ptr target="#PHOM"/> and section <ptr target="#PHDA"/>.</p>
</div>

<div type="div3" xml:id="PHSU"><head>Substitutions</head>

<p>Substitution of one word or phrase for another is perhaps the most
common of all phenomena requiring special treatment in transcription
of primary textual sources.  It may be simply one word overwriting
another, or deletion of one word and its replacement by another
written above it by the same hand at the one time; the deletion and
replacement may be done by different hands at different times; there
may be a long chain of substitutions on the one stretch of text, with
uncertainty as to the order of substitution and as to which of many
possible readings should be preferred.</p>
<p>As we have shown, the simplest method of recording a substitution
is simply to record both the addition and the deletion. However, when
the module defined by this chapter is in use, an additional element is
available to indicate that the encoder believes the addition and the
deletion to be part of the same intervention: a substitution.
<specList>
<specDesc key="subst"/>
</specList>
Using this element, the example at the end of the last section might
be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>
   <delSpan rend="verticalStrike" spanTo="#delend02"/>
   Tis moonlight <subst><del>upon</del><add>over</add></subst> Oman's sky</l>
<l>Her isles of pearl look lovelily<anchor xml:id="delend02"/></l></egXML>
Since the purpose of this element is solely to group its child elements
together, the order in which they are presented is not significant. By
convention, however, deletion precedes addition. This may be
over-ridden by means of the <att>seq</att> attribute, which is of
particular usefulness when a sequence of deletions and additions
occurs.
</p>

<p>For example, returning to the example from William James, in a
passage first written out by James as <q>One must have lived longer
with this system, to appreciate its advantages</q> the word
<mentioned>this</mentioned> is first replaced by <mentioned>such
a</mentioned> and this is then replaced by <mentioned>a</mentioned>.
<note place="foot">The manuscript contains several other
substitutions, ignored here for the sake of clarity.</note> This may
be encoded as follows, representing the two changes as a sequence of
additions and deletions: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">One must have lived longer
with <subst><del seq="1">this</del> <del seq="2"><add seq="1">such
a</add></del> <add seq="2">a</add></subst> system, to appreciate its
advantages.</egXML> Note the nesting of an <gi>add</gi> element within
a <gi>del</gi> to record text first added, then deleted in the
source. The numbers assigned by the <att>seq</att> attribute may be
used to identify the order in which the various additions and
deletions are believed by the encoder to have been carried out, and
thus provide a simple method of supporting the kind of
<soCalled>genetic</soCalled> textual criticism typified by (for
example) Hans Walter Gabler's work on the reconstruction of the
<q>overlay</q> levels of implicit in the manuscripts of James Joyce's
<title>Ulysses</title>.
</p>
<p>As a more complex example, consider the following passage in one of
the manuscripts of Wilfred Owen's <title>Dulce et decorum
est</title><note place="foot">Reproduced here from the British Library
online copy at <ptr target="http://www.bl.uk/learning/images/changing/new/large4964.html"/></note>:
<figure><graphic url="Images/PHowen.png"/></figure>
This passage might be encoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<l><del>Deaf even</del> Drunk with fatigue ; deaf even to the
hoots</l>
<l>Of <subst><del seq="1" status="partial">tired, outstripped
Five-Nines</del><del seq="3"><add seq="2">gas
shells</add></del><add seq="3">gas shells dropping
softly</add></subst> that dropped behind.</l></egXML>
In this representation, 
<list>
<item>the words <mentioned>Deaf even</mentioned> in the first line are simply marked as
a deletion</item>
<item>all the changes in the second line are treated as a single
substitution, with three distinct phases:
<list type="ordered">
<item>the words <mentioned>tired, outstripped Five-Nines</mentioned>
are deleted (the <att>status</att> attribute indicates that this
deletion is partial because the last three letters of
<mentioned>outstripped</mentioned> and the first two of
<mentioned>Five</mentioned> are not actually cancelled)</item>
<item>the word <mentioned>gas-shells</mentioned> is added</item>
<item>the word  <mentioned>gas-shells</mentioned> is deleted and the
words <mentioned>dropping softly</mentioned> added.</item>
</list></item></list>
</p>
<p>The <gi>app</gi> element presented in chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>
provides similar facilities, by treating each state of the text as a
distinct reading. The <gi>rdg</gi> element has a <att>varSeq</att>
attribute which may be used in the same way as the
<att>seq</att> attribute to indicate the preferred sequence. The James
example above might thus be represented as follows: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">One must have lived longer with
  <app>
    <rdg varSeq="1"><del>this</del></rdg>
    <rdg varSeq="2"><del><add>such a</add></del></rdg>
    <rdg varSeq="3"><add>a</add></rdg>
  </app>
system, to appreciate its advantages.</egXML>
</p></div>

<div type="div3" xml:id="PHCD"><head>Cancellation of Deletions and Other Markings</head>
<p>An author or scribe may mark a word or phrase in some way, and then
on reflection decide to cancel the marking.  For example, text may be
marked for deletion and the deletion then cancelled, thus restoring the
deleted text.  Such cancellation may be indicated by the
<gi>restore</gi> element:
<specList><specDesc key="restore"/></specList></p>
<p>This element bears the same attributes as the other transcriptional
elements. These may be used to supply further information such as
the hand in which the restoration is carried out, the type of
restoration, and the person
rsponsible for identifying the restoration as such, in the same way as
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Presume that Lawrence decided to restore <mentioned>my</mentioned> to the
phrase of <title>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani</title> first written
<q>For I hate this my body</q>, with the <mentioned>my</mentioned> first deleted
then restored by writing <q>stet</q> in the margin.  This may be
encoded:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">For I hate this
<restore hand="#dhl" type="marginalStetNote"><del>my</del></restore>
body</egXML></p>
<p>Another feature commonly encountered in manuscripts is the use of
circles, lines, or arrows to indicate transposition of material from
one point in the text to another. No specific markup for this
phenomenon is proposed at this time. Such cases are most simply
encoded as additions at the point of insertion and deletions at the
point of encirclement or other marking. </p>
</div>

<div type="div3" xml:id="PHOM">
<head>Text Omitted from or Supplied in the Transcription</head>
<p>Where text is not transcribed, whether because of damage to the
original, or because it is illegible, or for some other reason such as editorial policy,
the <gi>gap</gi> core element should be used to register the omission;
where text not present in the source is supplied (whether
conjecturally or from other witnesses) to fill an apparent gap in the
text, it should be marked using the <gi>supplied</gi> element provided
by the module defined in this chapter.
<specList><specDesc key="gap" atts="reason hand agent"/>
<specDesc key="supplied" atts="reason"/></specList></p>
<p>By its nature, the <gi>gap</gi> element has no content.  It
marks a point in the text where nothing at all can be read, whether because
of  authorial or scribal erasure, physical damage, or any other form
of  illegibility.  Its attributes allow the encoder to specify the
amount of text which is illegible in this way at this point, using any
convenient units, where
this can be determined.  For example, in
the Beerbohm manuscript of <title>The Golden Drugget</title> cited
above, the author has erased a passage amounting about 10 cm in length
by inking over it completely:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Others <gap reason="cancelled" hand="#mb" extent="10" unit="cm"/>—and
here is one of them...</egXML></p>
<p>In an autograph letter of Sydney Smith in the Pierpont Morgan
library,<note place="foot">(Klinkenborg 11)</note> three words in the signature are quite illegible:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">I am dr Sr yr <gap reason="illegible" extent="3" unit="word"/>Sydney Smith</egXML>

The degree of
precision attempted when measuring the size of a gap will vary with the purpose of the encoding and the
nature of the material: no particular recommendation is made here.</p>

<p>As noted above, the <gi>gap</gi> element should only be used where
text has not been transcribed; if partially legible text has been
transcribed, one of the elements <gi>damage</gi> and <gi>unclear</gi>
should be used instead. These elements 
are described in section <ptr target="#PHDA"/>.</p>

<p>If the source text is completely illegible or missing, an encoder
may sometimes wish to supply new (conjectural) material to replace it.
This conjectural reading is analogous to a correction in that it
contains text provided by the encoder and not attested in the
source. This is not however a correction, since no error is
necessarily present in the original; for that reason a different
element <gi>supplied</gi> should be used.
If another (imaginary) copy of the letter above preserved the
signature as reading <q>I am dear Sir your very humble Servt Sydney
Smith</q>, the text illegible in the autograph might be supplied in
the transcription: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">I
am dr Sr yr <supplied reason="illegible" resp="#msm" source="#AmCo">very humble Servt</supplied> Sydney Smith</egXML> Here
the <att>source</att> and <att>resp</att> attributes are used, as
elsewhere, to indicate respectively the sigil of a manuscript from
which the supplied reading has been taken, and the identifier of the
person responsible for deciding to supply the text. If the
<att>source</att> attribute is not supplied, the implication is that
the encoder (or whoever is indicated by the value of the
<att>resp</att> attribute) has supplied the missing reading.  Both
<gi>gap</gi> and <gi>supplied</gi> may be used in combination with
<gi>unclear</gi>, <gi>damage</gi>, and other elements; for discussion,
see section <ptr target="#PHCOMB"/>.</p>
</div></div>

<div type="div2" xml:id="PHPH"><head>Hands and Responsibility</head>
<p>This section discusses in more detail the representation of aspects
of responsibility perceived or to be recorded for the writing of a
primary source. These include points at which one scribe takes over
from another, or at which ink, pen, or other characteristics of the
writing change. A discussion of the usage of the <att>hand</att>,
<att>resp</att>, and <att>cert</att> attributes is also included.
</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="PHDH"><head>Document Hands</head>

<p>For many text-critical purposes it is important to signal the
person responsible (the <term>hand</term>) for the writing of a whole
document, a stretch of text within a document, or a particular feature
within the document.  A hand, as the name suggests, need not
necessarily be identified with a particular known (or unknown) scribe
or author; it may simply indicate a particular combination of writing
features recognized within one or more documents. The examples given
above of the use of the <att>hand</att> attribute with coding of
additions and deletions illustrate this. </p>

<p>The <gi>handNote</gi> element is used to provide information about
each hand distinguished within the encoded document. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="handNote"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>A <gi>handNote</gi> element, with an identifier given by its
<att>xml:id</att> attribute, may appear in either of two places in the
TEI Header, depending on which modules are included in a schema. When
the <ident type="class">transcr</ident> module defined by the present
chapter is used, the element <gi>handNotes</gi> is available, within
the <gi>profileDesc</gi> element of the Header, to hold one or more
<gi>handNote</gi> elements. When the <ident type="class">msdescription</ident> module defined in chapter <ptr target="#MS"/> is included, the <gi>handDesc</gi> element described in
<ptr target="#msph2"/> also becomes available as part of a structured
manuscript description. The encoder may choose to place
<gi>handNote</gi> elements identifying individual hands in either
location without affecting their accessibility since the element is
always addressed by means of its <att>xml:id</att> attribute. The
<gi>handDesc</gi> element may be more appropriate when a full
cataloguing of each manuscript is required; the <gi>handNotes</gi>
element if only a brief characterization of each hand is needed.  It
is also possible to use the two elements together if, for example, the
<gi>handDesc</gi> element contains a single summary describing all the
hands discursively, while the <gi>handNotes</gi> element gives
specific details of each. The choice will depend on individual
encoders' priorities.</p>

<p>As shown above, the <att>hand</att> attribute is available on
several elements to indicate the hand in which the content of the
element (usually a deletion or addition) is carried out. The
<gi>handShift</gi> element may also be used within the body of a
transcription to indicate where a change of hand is detected for
whatever reason. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="handShift"/></specList>
</p>
<p>Both <gi>handShift</gi> and <gi>handNote</gi>  are members of the
<ident type="class">att.handFeatures</ident> class, and thus share
the following attributes:
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.handFeatures" atts="scribe script medium scope"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>A single hand may employ different writing styles and inks within a
document, or may change character.  For example, the writing style
might shift from <q>anglicana</q> to <q>secretary</q>, or the ink from
blue to brown, or the character of the hand may change.  Simple
changes of this kind may be indicated by assigning a new value to the
appropriate attribute within the <gi>handShift</gi> element.  It is
for the encoder to decide whether a change in these properties of the
writing style is so marked as to require treatment as a distinct
hand.</p>
<p>Where such a change is to be identified, the <att>new</att>
attribute is used to indicate the hand applicable to the material
following the <gi>handShift</gi>.  This will ordinarily, but not
necessarily, be the order in which the material was originally
written.</p>

<p> As might be expected, one hand may employ different renditions
within the one writing style, for example medieval scribes often
indicate a structural division by emboldening all the words within a
line.  These should be indicated by use of the <att>rend</att>
attribute on an element, in the same manner as underlining,
emboldening, font shifts, etc. are represented in transcription of a printed text,
rather than by introducing a new <gi>handShift</gi> element.</p>

<p>In this example<note place="foot">From folio 52 recto of the Holkham
manuscript of Chaucer's <title>Canterbury Tales</title>.</note> there is
a change of ink within the one hand.  This is simply indicated by a new value
for the <att>medium</att> attribute on the <gi>handShift</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>When wolde the cat dwelle in his ynne</l>
<handShift medium="greenish-ink"/>
<l>And if the cattes skynne be slyk <handShift medium="black-ink"/> and gaye</l></egXML></p>

<p>In this example<note place="foot">From the Wiltshire Record Office,
Dean of Sarum Churchwardens' presentments, 1731, Hurst; the
transcription was provided by Donald A. Spaeth.</note> the encoder has
identified two distinct hands within the document. These are given
identifiers <val>h1</val> and <val>h2</val> by the following
declarations, included in the TEI Header for this document:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <handNotes>
      <handNote xml:id="h1" script="copperplate" medium="brown-ink">Carefully written with regular descenders</handNote>
      <handNote xml:id="h2" script="print" medium="pencil">Unschooled scrawl</handNote>
    </handNotes>
 </egXML>
</p>
<p>Then the change of hand is indicated in the text:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><handShift new="#h1" resp="#das"/>... and that good Order Decency and regular worship
may be once more introduced and Established in this
Parish according to the Rules and Ceremonies of the
Church of England and as under a good Consciencious
and sober Curate there would and ought to be
<handShift new="#h2" resp="#das"/>
and for that purpose the parishioners pray</egXML></p>
</div>

<div type="div3" xml:id="PHHR">
<head>Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes</head>

<p>The <att>hand</att> and <att>resp</att> attributes have similar, but
not identical, meanings.  Observe their distinctive uses in the
following encoding of the William James passage mentioned above in
section <ptr target="#PHCC"/>.  In this example, the <mentioned>But</mentioned>
inserted by James is tagged as an <gi>add</gi>, and the consequent
editorial correction of <mentioned>One</mentioned> to <mentioned>one</mentioned> treated
separately:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><add place="supralinear" resp="#FB" hand="#WJ">But</add>
<choice><sic>One</sic><corr resp="#FB">one</corr></choice> must have
lived ...
<!-- elsewhere -->
<respStmt xml:id="FB">
<resp>editorial changes</resp>
<name>Fredson Bowers</name>
</respStmt>
<respStmt xml:id="WJ">
<resp>authorial changes</resp>
<name>William James</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML>
As in this example, <att>hand</att> should be reserved for indicating
the hand of any form of marking—here, addition but also deletion,
correction, annotation, underlining, etc.—within the primary text
being transcribed.  The scribal or authorial responsibility for this
marking may be inferred from the value of the <att>hand</att> attribute.
The value of the <att>hand</att> attribute should be one of the hand
identifiers declared in the document header (see section <ptr target="#PHDH"/>).</p>
<p>The <att>resp</att> attribute, by contrast, 
indicate the person responsible for deciding to apply the element
carrying it to this part of the text, and hence has a slightly
different interpretation.  In the case of the
<gi>add</gi> element, for example, the <att>resp</att> attribute will
indicate  the responsibility for identifying that the addition is
indeed an addition, and also (if the <att>hand</att> attribute is
supplied) to which hand it should be attributed. In this case, 
Bowers is credited with  identifying the hand as that of William
James. In the case of the <gi>corr</gi> element, the <att>resp</att>
attribute indicates who is responsible for supplying the
intellectual content of the correction reported in the transcription:
here, Bowers' correction of <q>One</q> to <q>one</q>. In the case of a
deletion, the <att>resp</att> attribute will similarly indicate who
bears responsibility for identifying or categorising the deletion itself,
while other attributes (<att>hand</att> most obviously) attribute
responsibility for the deletion itself.</p>

<p>As these examples show, the field of application of the
<att>resp</att> attributes varies from element to element.  In some
cases, it applies to the content of the element (<gi>corr</gi>, 
<gi>ex</gi>, and <gi>supplied</gi>); in others it applies to the value of a particular
attribute (<gi>sic</gi>, <gi>abbr</gi>, <gi>del</gi>, etc.).  In all
cases where both the <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att> attributes are
defined for a particular element, the two attributes refer to the same
aspect of the markup.  The one indicates who is intellectually
responsible for some item of information, the other indicates the degree
of confidence in the information.  Thus, for a
correction, the <att>resp</att> attribute signifies the person
responsible for supplying the correction, while the <att>cert</att>
attribute signifies the degree of editorial confidence felt in that
correction.  For the expansion of an abbreviation, the
<att>resp</att> attribute signifies the person responsible for supplying
the expansion and the <att>cert</att> attribute signifies the degree of
editorial confidence felt in the expansion.</p>
<p>This close definition of the use of the <att>resp</att> and
<att>cert</att> attributes with each element is intended to provide for
the most frequent circumstances in which encoders might wish to make
unambiguous statements regarding the responsibility for and certainty of
aspects of their encoding.  The <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att>
attributes, as so defined, give a convenient mechanism for this.
However, there will be cases where it is desired to state responsibility
for and certainty concerning other aspects of the encoding.  For
example, one may wish in the case of an apparent addition to state the
responsibility for the use of the <gi>add</gi> element, rather than the
responsibility for identifying the hand of the addition.  It may also be
that one editor may make an electronic transcription of another editor's
printed transcription of a manuscript text — here, one will wish to
assign layers of responsibility, so as to allow the reader to determine
exactly what in the final transcription was the
responsibility of each editor.  In these complex cases of divided
editorial responsibility for and certainty concerning the content,
attributes, and application of a particular element, the more general
mechanisms for representing certainty and responsibility described in
chapter <ptr target="#CE"/> should be used.</p>
<!--
<p>The fields of reference of the <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att>
attributes for each element have been chosen to enable what are felt as
the most frequent likely statements an encoder may wish to make
concerning the areas of responsibility and certainty related to that
element.  It is open to each local transcription scheme to vary the use
of the <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att> attributes on particular
elements where it is felt convenient.  This practice should be
documented in the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element in the file header.
Further, it is recommended that before interchange any such local usage
of these attributes be converted to conformancy with the definitions of
the <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att> attributes given in these
<title>Guidelines</title>.  Use of the <att>resp</att> and
<att>cert</att> in interchange documents in ways not here defined may
lead to unpredictable results.</p>
-->
<p>It should be noted that the certainty and responsibility mechanisms
described in chapter <ptr target="#CE"/> replicate all the functions of the
<att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att> attributes on particular elements.
For example, the encoding of Donaldson's conjectured emendation of
<mentioned>wight</mentioned> to <mentioned>wright</mentioned> in line 117 of Chaucer's
<title>Wife of Bath's Prologue</title> (see <ptr target="#PHCC"/>) may be
encoded as follows using the <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att>
attributes on the <gi>corr</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<choice><sic>wight</sic><corr resp="#ETD" cert="medium">wright</corr></choice></egXML>
Exactly the same information could be conveyed using the certainty
and responsibility mechanisms, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<choice><corr xml:id="c117">wright</corr><sic>wight</sic></choice>
<certainty target="#c117" locus="transcribedContent" degree="0.7"/>
<respons target="#c117" locus="transcribedContent" resp="#ETD"/></egXML>
The choice of which mechanism to use is left to the encoder.  In
transcriptions where only such statements of responsibility and
certainty are made as can be accommodated within the <att>resp</att> and
<att>cert</att> attributes of particular elements, it will be economical
to use the <att>resp</att> and <att>cert</att> attributes of those
elements.  Where many statements of responsibility and certainty are
made which cannot be so accommodated, it may be economical to use the
<gi>respons</gi> and <gi>certainty</gi> elements throughout.</p>
<p>The above discussion supposes that in each case an encoder is able to
specify exactly what it is that one wishes to state responsibility for
and certainty about.  Situations may arise when an encoder wishes to
make a statement concerning certainty or responsibility but is unable or
unwilling to specify so precisely the domain of the certainty or
responsibility.  In these cases, the <gi>note</gi> element may be used
with the <att>type</att> attribute set to <q>cert</q> or <q>resp</q>
and the content of the note giving a prose description of the state of
affairs.</p></div></div>

<div><head>Damage and Conjecture</head>
<p>The carrier medium of a primary source may often sustain physical
damage which makes parts of it hard or impossible to read. In this
section we discuss elements which may be used to represent such
situations and give recommendations about how these should be used in
conjunction with the other related elements introduced previously in
this chapter. </p>


<div type="div3" xml:id="PHDA"><head>Damage, Illegibility, and Supplied Text</head>
<p>The <gi>gap</gi> and <gi>supplied</gi> elements described above
(section <ptr target="#PHOM"/>) should be used with appropriate
attributes where the degree of damage or illegibility in a text is
such that nothing can be read and the text must be either omitted or
supplied conjecturally or from one or more other sources.  In many
cases, however, despite damage or illegibility, the text may yet be
read with reasonable confidence.  In these cases, the following
elements should be used: <specList>
<specDesc key="damage"/>
<specDesc key="damageSpan"/>
</specList>
As members of the class <ident type="class">att.damaged</ident>, these elements  bear
the following attributes
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.damaged" atts="extent hand agent degree group"/>
</specList>
As a member of the <ident type="class">att.spanning</ident> class,
<gi>damageSpan</gi> inherits  the following additional attribute:
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.spanning" atts="spanTo"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>The following examples refer to the recto of folio 5 of the unique
manuscript of the Elder Edda.<note place="foot">Codex Regius, ed.  L. F.
A. Wimmer and F. Jónsson (Copenhagen 1891).</note> Here, the
manuscript of <title>Vóluspá</title> has been damaged
through irregular rubbing so that letters in various places are obscured
and in some cases cannot be read at all.  
</p>
<p>In the first line of this leaf, the transcriber may believe that the
last three letters of <mentioned>daga</mentioned> can be read clearly despite
the damage:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">um aldr
d<damage>aga</damage> yndisniota</egXML>
</p>
<p>If, as is often the case,  the damage crosses structural divisions, so
that the <gi>damage</gi> element cannot be  nested properly within the containing
<gi>div</gi> elements, the <gi>damageSpan</gi> element may be used, in
the same way as the <gi>delSpan</gi> and <gi>addSpan</gi> elements
discussed in section <ptr target="#PHAD"/>.  
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>
<!-- ... -->
  <pb n="5r"/>
  <damageSpan agent="rubbing" extent="whole leaf" spanTo="#damageEnd"/>
</p>
<p> .... </p>
<p> ....
  <pb n="5v" xml:id="damageEnd"/>
</p></egXML>
Note that in this example the <att>spanTo</att> element points to the
next <gi>pb</gi> element rather than to an inserted <gi>anchor</gi>
element, since the whole of the leaf (the text between the two
<gi>pb</gi> elements has sustained damage. For other techniques of handling non-nesting information, see chapter
<ptr target="#NH"/>.</p>
<p>If, as is also likely, the damage affects several disjoint parts of
the text, each such part must be marked with a separate
<gi>damage</gi> or <gi>damageSpan</gi> element. To indicate that each of these is to be
regarded as forming part of the same damaged area, the <att>group</att>
attribute may be used as in the following example. In this (imaginary)
text of Fitzgerald's translation from Omar Khayam, 
water damage has affected an area covering parts of several lines
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>
The Moving Finger wri<damage agent="water" group="1">es; and</damage> having writ,</l>
<l>Moves <damage agent="water" group="1">on: nor all your</damage> Piety nor Wit</l>
<l><damageSpan agent="water" group="1" spanTo="#washOut"/>Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,</l>
<l>Nor all your Tears wash <anchor xml:id="washOut"/> out a Word of it</l>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>A more general solution to this problem is provided by the
<gi>join</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#SAAG"/> which may be
used to link together arbitrary elements of any kind in the
transcription. Where, as here, several phenomena of illegibility and conjecture
all result from the one cause, an area of damage to the text — rubbing
at various points — which is not continuous in the text, affecting it
at irregular points, the <gi>join</gi> element may be
used to indicate which tagged features are part of the same physical
phenomenon. </p>

<p>If the damage has been so severe as to render parts of the text
only  imperfectly
legible, the  <gi>unclear</gi> element should be used to mark the
fact. Returning to the Eddic example above, an encoder less confident
in the <mentioned>daga</mentioned> reading, may indicate this as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">um aldr d<unclear reason="damage">aga</unclear> yndisniota</egXML></p>
<p>If it is desired to supply more information about the kind of
damage, it is also possible to nest an <gi>unclear</gi> element within
the <gi>damage</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">um aldr d<damage agent="rubbing"><unclear>aga</unclear></damage> yndisniota</egXML></p>
<p>Alternatively, the transcriber may not feel able to read the last
three letters of <mentioned>daga</mentioned> but may wish to supply them by
conjecture. Note the use of the <att>resp</att> attribute to assign
the conjecture to Finnur Jónsson:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">um aldr d<supplied reason="rubbing" resp="#FJ">aga</supplied> yndisniota</egXML>
The <gi>supplied</gi> element may if desired be enclosed within a
<gi>damage</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">um aldr d<damage agent="rubbing"><supplied source="FJ">aga</supplied></damage> yndisniota</egXML></p>
<p>Contrast the use of <gi>gap</gi> in the next line, where the
transcriber believes that four letters cannot be read at all because
of the damage:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">þar komr inn dimmi dreki fliugandi naþr frann
neþan <gap reason="illegible" agent="rubbing" extent="4" unit="letters"/></egXML>
As with <gi>supplied</gi>, this <gi>gap</gi> might be enclosed by a
<gi>damage</gi> element.</p>
<p>The above examples record imperfect legibility due to damage.  When
imperfect legibility is due to some other reason (typically because the
handwriting is ill-formed), the <gi>unclear</gi> element should be used
without any enclosing <gi>damage</gi> element.  In Robert Southey's
autograph of <title>The Life of Cowper</title>,<note place="foot">In
Pierpont Morgan MA 412 (Klinkenborg 15).</note> the final six letters
of <mentioned>attention</mentioned> are difficult to read because of the haste
of the writing, though reasonably certain from the context.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">and from time to time invited in like manner
his att<unclear>ention</unclear></egXML>
The <att>cert</att> attribute on the <gi>unclear</gi> element may be
used to indicate the level of editorial confidence in the reading
contained within it.</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="PHCOMB"><head>Use of the <gi>gap</gi>, <gi>del</gi>, <gi>damage</gi>, <gi>unclear</gi>, and <gi>supplied</gi> Elements in Combination</head>
<p>The <gi>gap</gi>, <gi>damage</gi>, <gi>unclear</gi>,
<gi>supplied</gi>, and <gi>del</gi> elements may be closely allied in
their use.  For example, an area of damage in a primary source might
be encoded with any one of the first four of these elements, depending on
how far the damage has affected the readability of the text.
Further, certain of the elements may nest within one another. The
examples given in the last sections illustrate something of how these
elements are to be distinguished in use.  This may be formulated as
follows:
<list type="bullets">
<item>where the text has been rendered completely illegible by
deletion or damage and no text is supplied by the editor in place of
what is lost: place an empty <gi>gap</gi> element at the point of
deletion or damage.  Use the <att>reason</att> attribute to state the
cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the loss of text.</item>
<item>where the text has been rendered completely illegible by
deletion or damage and text is supplied by the editor in place of
what is lost: surround the text supplied at the point of deletion or
damage with the <gi>supplied</gi> element.  Use the <att>reason</att>
attribute to state the cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the loss of
text leading to the need to supply the text.</item>
<item>where the text has been rendered partly illegible by deletion
or damage so that the text can be read but without perfect
confidence: transcribe the text and surround it with the
<gi>unclear</gi> element.  Use the <att>reason</att> attribute to state
the cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the uncertainty in transcription
and the <att>cert</att> attribute to indicate the confidence in the
transcription.</item>
<item>where there is deletion or damage but the text can be read with
perfect confidence: transcribe the text and surround it with the
<gi>del</gi> element (for deletion) or the <gi>damage</gi> element (for
damage).  Use appropriate attribute values to indicate the cause and
type of deletion or damage.  Observe that the <att>degree</att>
attribute on the <gi>damage</gi> element permits the encoding to show
that a letter, word, or phrase is not perfectly preserved, though it
may be read with confidence.</item>
<item>where there is an area of deletion or damage and parts of the
text within that area can be read with perfect confidence, other
parts with less confidence, other parts not at all: in transcription,
surround the whole area  with the <gi>del</gi> element (for deletion; or
the <gi>delSpan</gi> element where it crosses a structural boundary); or
the <gi>damage</gi> element (for damage).  Text within the damaged area
which can be read with perfect confidence needs no further tagging.
Text within the damaged area which cannot be read with perfect
confidence may be surrounded with the <gi>unclear</gi> element.  Places
within the damaged area where the text has been rendered completely
illegible and no text is supplied by the editor may be marked with
the <gi>gap</gi> element. For each element, one may use appropriate
attribute values to indicate the cause and type of deletion or damage
and the certainty of the reading.</item></list></p>
<p>The rules for combinations of the <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi>
elements, and for the interpretation of such combinations, are
similar:
<list type="bullets">
<item>if one <gi>add</gi> element (with identifier <ident>ADD1</ident>)
contains another (with identifier <ident>ADD2</ident>), then
the addition <ident>ADD1</ident> was first
made to the text, and later a second addition (<ident>ADD2</ident>) was
made within that added text:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">This is the text
<add xml:id="ADD1">with some added
   <add xml:id="ADD2">(interlinear!)</add>
material</add>
as written.</egXML></item>
<item>if one <gi>del</gi> element contains another, and the
<att>seq</att> attribute does not indicate otherwise, it should be
assumed that the inner 
deletion was made before the enclosing one. In the following example,
the words <mentioned>redundant</mentioned> was deleted before a second
second deletion removed the entire passage:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><del>This sentence contains
some <del>redundant</del> unnecessary
verbiage.</del></egXML></item>
<item>if a <gi>del</gi> element contains an <gi>add</gi> element, the normal
interpretation will be that an addition was made within a passage
which was later
deleted in its entirety:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><del>This sentence was deleted
<add>originally</add> from the text.</del></egXML></item>
<item>if an <gi>add</gi> element contains a <gi>del</gi> element, the
normal interpretation will be that a
deletion was made from  a passage which had earlier been added:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><add>This sentence was added
<del>eventually</del> to the text.</add></egXML></item>
</list></p></div>
</div>


<div><head>Aspects of Layout</head>
<p>Finally in this chapter we present elements which may be used to
capture aspects of the layout of material on a page where this is
considered important.  Methods for recording page breaks, column breaks, and line breaks in the
source are described in section <ptr target="#CORS"/>.
</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="PHSP"><head>Space</head>
<p>The author or scribe may
have left space for a word, or for an initial capital, and for some
reason the word or capital was never supplied and the space left empty.
The presence of significant space in the text being transcribed may
be indicated by the <gi>space</gi> element.  
<specList><specDesc key="space" atts="resp"/></specList>
Note that this element should not be used to mark normal inter-word space or the
like. </p>
<p>In line 694 of Chaucer's <title>Wife of Bath's Prologue</title> in
the Holkham manuscript the scribe has left a space for a word where
other manuscripts read <mentioned>preestes</mentioned>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">By god if wommen had writen storyes
As <space quantity="7" unit="char"/> han within her oratoryes</egXML>
The <gi>supplied</gi> element discussed in the previous section may be
used to supply the text presumed missing:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">By god if wommen had writen storyes
As <supplied reason="space" resp="#ES" source="Hg">preestes</supplied>
han within her oratoryes</egXML>
Here, the fact of the space within the manuscript is indicated by the
value of the <att>reason</att> attribute.  The source of the supplied
text is shown by the value of the <att>source</att> attribute as the
Hengwrt manuscript; the transcriber responsible for supplying the text
is ES.
</p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="PHLN"><head>Lines</head>
<p>The most common form of marking of text in manuscripts is by lines
written under, beside, or through the text.  The lines themselves may be
of various types:  they may be solid, dashed or dotted, doubled or
tripled, wavy or straight, or a combination of these and other
renderings.  The line may be used for emphasis, or to mark a foreign or
technical term, or to signal a quotation or a title, etc.:  the elements
<gi>emph</gi>, <gi>foreign</gi>, <gi>term</gi>, <gi>mentioned</gi>,
<gi>title</gi> may be used for these.  Frequently, a scholar may judge
that a line is used to delete text:  the <gi>del</gi> element is
available to indicate this.  In all these cases, the <att>rend</att>
attribute may be used on these or other elements to indicate that the
text is marked by a line and the style of the line.  Thus, Lawrence's
deletion by strike-through of <mentioned>my</mentioned> in the autograph of
<title>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani</title> is noted:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">For I hate this
<del rend="strikethrough" hand="#dhl">my</del> body,
which is so dear to me</egXML></p>
<p>There will be instances, however, where a scholar wishes only to
register the occurrence of lines in the text, without making any
judgement as to what the lines signify.  In these the <gi>hi</gi>
element may be used, with the <att>rend</att> attribute to mark the
style of line.  In the manuscript of a letter by Robert Browning to
George Moulton-Barrett,<note place="foot">Pierpont Morgan MA 310, (Klinkenborg 23)</note> the
underlining of the phrase <mentioned>had obtained all the letters to Mr Boyd</mentioned>
may be marked-up as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">I have once — by declaring I would prosecute
by law — hindered a man's proceedings who
<hi rend="underline">had obtained all the letters
to Mr Boyd</hi></egXML></p>
<p>The above examples presume the common case where a single word or
phrase is marked by a line, with no doubt as to where the marking begins
or ends and with no overlapping of the area of text with other marked
areas of text.  Where there is doubt, the <gi>certainty</gi> element may
be used to record the doubt.  In the Browning example cited above the
underlining actually begins half-way under <mentioned>who</mentioned>, and this
uncertainty could be remarked as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">I have once — by declaring I would prosecute
by law — hindered a man's proceedings who
<hi xml:id="cstart1" rend="underline">had obtained all
the letters to Mr Boyd</hi>
<!-- ... -->
<certainty target="#cstart1" locus="startLoc" degree="0.70">
<desc>may begin with previous word</desc>
</certainty></egXML></p>
<p>Where the area of text marked overlaps other areas of text, for
example crossing a structural division, one of the spanning mechanisms
mentioned above must be used; for example where the line is thought to
mark a deletion, the <gi>delSpan</gi> element may be used.  Where it is
desired simply to record the marking of a span of text in circumstances
where it is not possible to surround the text with a <gi>hi</gi>
element, the <gi>span</gi> element may be used with the <att>rend</att>
attribute indicating the style of line-marking.</p>
<p>More work needs to be done on clarifying the treatment of other
textual features marked by lines which might so overlap or nest.  For
example, in many Middle English manuscripts (e.g. the Jesus and Digby
verse collections) marginal sidebars may indicate metrical structure:
couplets may be linked in pairs, with the pairs themselves linked
into stanzas. Or, marginal sidebars may indicate emphasis, or may
point out a region of text on which there is some annotation: in many
manuscripts of Chaucer's <title>Wife of Bath's Prologue</title> lines
655–8 are marked with nesting parentheses against which the scribe
has written <mentioned>nota</mentioned>.</p>
<p>At the lowest level, all such features could be captured by use of
the <gi>note</gi> element, containing a prose description of the
manuscript at this point, enhanced by a link to a visual
representation (or facsimile) of the feature in question.  
It is not yet clear how best to mark up such
phenomena so as to
obtain more usefully structured encodings.  For example,
in the Chaucer example just cited, one may wish to record that the
<mentioned>nota</mentioned> is written in the Hengwrt manuscript in the right
margin against a single large left parenthesis bracketing the four
lines, with two right parentheses in the right margin bracketing two
overlapping pairs of lines:  the first and third, the second and fourth.
The <gi>note</gi> element allows us to record that the scribe wrote
<mentioned>nota</mentioned>, but is not well-adapted to show that the
<mentioned>nota</mentioned> points both at all four lines and at two pairs of
lines within the four lines.  </p></div></div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="PHSK"><head>Headers, Footers, and Similar Matter</head>
<p>As a rule, matter associated with the page break (signature,
catchword, page number) should be drawn into the <gi>pb</gi> element
as attributes:  see section <ptr target="#CORS"/>.  In text-critical
situations where these elements need tagging in their own right (for
instance, when the catch-word presents a variant reading, or spacing
in the header or footer is significant for compositor identification),
the element <gi>fw</gi> may be used:
<specList><specDesc key="fw"/></specList>
The name <mentioned>fw</mentioned> is short for <q>forme work</q>. It
may be used  to encode any of
the unchanging portions of a page forme, such as:
<list type="bullets">
<item>running heads (whether repeated on every page, or changing on
every page)</item>
<item>running footers</item>
<item>page numbers</item>
<item>catch-words</item>
<item>other material repeated from page to page, which falls outside the
stream of the text</item></list>
It should not be used for marginal glosses, annotations, or textual
variants, which should be tagged using <gi>gloss</gi>, <gi>note</gi>, or
the text-critical tags described in chapter <ptr target="#TC"/>,
respectively.</p>
<p>For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><fw type="head" place="top-centre">Poëms.</fw>
<fw type="pageNum" place="top-right">29</fw>
<fw type="sig" place="bot-centre">E3</fw>

<div type="div2" xml:id="PHTRXX"><head>Other Primary Source Features not Covered in these Guidelines</head>
<p>We repeat the advice given at the beginning of this chapter, that
these recommendations are not intended to meet every transcriptional

These guidelines particularly do not address the encoding of physical
description of textual witnesses:  the materials of the carrier, the
medium of the inscribing implement, 
the organisation of the carrier materials themselves (as
