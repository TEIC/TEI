                <p>The manuscript as it now stands consists of 181 parchment <term type="bla"
                        >folios</term>, plus two <hi>modern</hi> paper flyleaves at each end. Each page is
                    approximately 315 mm x 205 mm. It is bound in a <date notBefore="1800"
                        notAfter="1900">nineteenth-century</date> binding, which is in need of
                    repair, on five medieval sewing-stations.</p>

                    <head>Ruling</head>
                    <p>The manuscript is written in a single column, fols. 1–165 in 28 lines, and
                        fols. 166–73 in 27 lines. 174r was ruled for 28 lines, but only 27 were
                        written, and from 175r to the end of the manuscript there are 27 ruled lines
                        per page. These were ruled drypoint before the parchment was folded. The
                        prickings in the outer margin seem to have been made with a triangular
                        point. The size of the writing area is approximately 250 x 145 mm, with 9–10
                        mm between ruled lines, and with a double vertical bounding line ruled to
                        provide space for litterae notabiliores. On occasion the gap between lines
                        is not regular, for example on fol. 180.</p>
