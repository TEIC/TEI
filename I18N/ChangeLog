	* reinames.xml: change structure of file to make faster processing
	using keys. now each element or attribute has a series of <equiv>
	children with lang and value attributes

2004-04-27  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* translate-frominstance.xsl: add script to go back from
	translated version to canonical version. Use URLs from TEI web
	site to get resources (slow, but portable)

2004-04-25  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* add translate-instance.xsl: converts elements and attributes in 
	a TEI P5 XML document to the chosen language.

	* add translate-odd.xsl: extends a TEI extension written in ODD to
	use element and attribute names from the chosen language

	* teinames.xml: removed quite a few cases where the translated
	name was no different to the english one

2004-04-24  Sebastian Rahtz  <rahtz@spqr-dell.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* teinames.xml: created by merging Alejandro Bia's translations
	with a list of elements, attributes and values derived from the P5
	ODD sources
