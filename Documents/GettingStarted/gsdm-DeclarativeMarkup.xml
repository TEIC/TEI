                    <head>XML as a markup meta-language</head>
                    <p>As mentioned in the <ref target="#tbxml">technical bakcgounrd section</ref>of
                        this document, the acronym <mentioned>XML</mentioned> stand for
                            <term>eXtensible Mark-up Language</term>. XML is indeed, first of all,
                        a <emph>language of markup</emph>or encoding, a language to annotate texts. </p>
                    <p>To be more precise, being a simplified derivative of SGML (Standard
                        Generalized Markup Language) developed by <ref target="http://www.w3.org/"
                            >W3C</ref> (World Wide Web Consortium), XML is actually a
                            <emph>meta-language</emph> of mark-up, a language for describing other
                        languages. A meta-language is a language which defines a methodology and
                        describes schemas of mark-up together with some requirements for achieving a
                            <soCalled>standardised</soCalled> encoding. Indeed, a first important
                        difference between HTML (Hypertextual Markup Language) and XML is the fact
                        that while HTML consists of a fixed set of tags, XML is extensible. This
                        means that it is possible to create new sets of tags with it.</p>

                    <head>XML as a declarative markup system</head>
                    <!--     contrast declarative markup with wysiwyg editing: less susceptible to change,
                        easily re-used in other contexts, unambiguous. 6p-->
                    <p>There are different types of markup. XML can be defined as a
                            <emph>declarative markup language</emph>, that is to say a markup system
                        based on the logical document model. It aims at describing the logical
                        structure of a document independent of its physical representation. </p>
                    <p>This type of markup is also called descriptive or semantic markup language
                        since the portions of a text are declared and defined on the basis of their
                        function or meaning. While HTML is mostly a presentational mark-up language,
                        XML describes what a textual portion means rather than how it should appear.
                        See, for instance, the following example:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item><label>HTML</label>In both the following cases <gi>i</gi> stands for
                            italics and it would be rendered in italics by browsers <egXML
                                xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                <i>Divina Commedia</i>
                            </egXML>
                            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>
                            </egXML>
                        </item>
                        <item><label>XML</label>
                            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                <title>Divina Commedia</title>
                            </egXML>
                            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                                <foreign>mens sana in corpore sano</foreign>
                            </egXML>
                            <gi>title</gi> indicates that the portion of text it wraps is a title,
                            no matter how it is going to be rendered; while <gi>foreign</gi>
                            indicates that the relevant text is in a language different from the one
                            of the main text, no matter how it is going to be displayed. </item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Thus, in XML: <list>
                            <item>in contrast with a presentational approach, the meaning of the
                                text is considered as separate from its display or presentation;</item>
                            <item>the meaning of the text is made explicit through one or more
                                levels of interpretation which are added to the text.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Indeed, an XML document aims to embed the meaning/s of the textual data it
                        describes, thus giving an interpretative representation of the actual
                        content of the text in question. It does so by excluding all the procedural
                        information related to the processing of the content for presentational
                        purposes. The textual content is therefore perceived as separate from the
                        formats of presentations it can potentially assume.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, the XML document can be considered as a sort of matrix from
                        which different presentational outputs can be generated: outputs to
                        different media (e.g. web, print) or different devices (e.g. computer, PDA,
                        mobile, speech browser) in different formats (e.g. HTML, TXT, PDF, XML,
                        XHTML). </p>

                        <p>In addition, while HTML is a markup that can be defined as linear, XML is
                            a <emph>hierarchical</emph> markup language, where portions of the text
                            are integrated within a hierarchical structure. So, for instance, the
                            HTML tags <gi>h1</gi> and <gi>h2</gi> specify a function of the portions
                            of text they wrap (heading of level 1 and heading of level 2,
                            respectively), but they can be inserted freely in the text without
                            restrictions on the relationships between different headings in the page
                            or between the headings and the relevant content underneath. This is a
                            useful approach for those types of texts which feature a poor or
                            inconsistent structure. Some have associated this type of linear markup
                            with the image of a necklace made of a string of beads. </p>

                            textual document are defined on the basis of their position. Indeed, XML
                            specifies both: <list>

                    <p>Since information in an XML document is stored in plain-text, a special
                        feature of it is its <emph>independence from hardware and software</emph>.
                        Therefore XML as international standard is considered to be particularly
                        efficient for the <emph>exchange of data</emph>. Indeed, if you email from
                        your PC an XML document created with your PC to a friend who has a MAC, she
                        will be able to open it, read it and eventually edit it and send it back to
                        you. By accepting and sending information in plain text format, programs
                        running on disparate platforms can communicate with each other and be
                        interoperable. </p>
                    <p>The international and worldwide use of XML is strengthen even more by the
                        fact that it fully supports <ref target="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</ref>
                        standard for character encoding. Unicode is an internationally recognized
                        standard which provides a unique number for every character, no matter what
                        the platform, the program, the language.</p>
                    <p>The fact that XML is platform and software independent makes it at the same

                        adaptation to new technologies. </p>

                    <p>When we think of a text, whatever type of text, what comes to mind is not a
                        unordered sequence of words, but a rather organized and meaningful structure
                        that can be more or less complex depending on the material in question.
                        Indeed, each discipline in the humanities claims to deal with, observe,
                        analyse, interpret and study specific types of text. These types of text
                        feature some idiosyncratic characteristics that can be generally subsumed
                        under the following multiple textual aspects and structures: <list>
                            <item><label>physical</label> e.g. the binding of a codex as opposite to
                                its gatherings, the erasures of some words on a version of a text,
                                the presence of colours in a text etc. </item>
                            <item><label>structural</label> e.g. divisions of a text into chapters,
                                columns, sections, stanzas etc. </item>
                            <item><label>implicit or extra textual</label> e.g. information on the
                                text's author and date, or on the provenance of a textual source and
                                the archival collection where is physically held etc. </item>
                            <item><label>semantic or interpretative</label> e.g. editorial
                                interventions, identification of variants, abbreviations, readings,
                                names of persons and places that occur in the text etc.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>These broad definitions of textual aspects are not necessarily exhaustive and
                        can be expanded and tailored to cover particular research aims and textual
                        phenomena. Indeed, potentially there are infinite ways of making, describing
                        and interpreting models of texts.</p>
                    <p>As a declarative markup language, XML can be used to mark the interpretation
                        of a text explicitly on the basis of a set of conventions to be followed
                        while encoding the text itself. Given its ability to express the structures
                        of texts, XML can be very powerful, especially when the texts to be encoded
                        follow a consistent organization and are of a substantial amount.</p>
                    <p>Based on the methodologies and conventions of a specific discipline, on the
                        editorial strategy, and on the objectives of study, a text can therefore be
                        organised in various abstract units of different type and size.</p>
                    <p>Because this idea of text as structurally meaningful object is deeply rooted
                        in the humanities and given the specific features of XML as described above,
                        it is easy to understand why XML is particularly suited to support the study
                        of texts for scholarly purposes.</p>
                    <p>In addition, because of the importance given to the hierarchical structure of
                        texts, XML supports an approach to the text that focuses very much on the
                        concept of type of document, on the meaningful structural constituents of
                        text rather than on its presentational appearance. So, for instance,
                        consider the following XML structure to encode a chapter within a book:

                            <div type="chapter">
                                <head>Chapter heading here</head>
                                <div type="lessons">
                                    <p>text of paragraph here</p>
                                    <p>other paragraphs would follow</p>
                                </div>

                                        <p>other paragraphs would follow</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div type="key_terms">
                                        <p>text of paragraph here</p>

                                <div type="resources">
                                    <div type="additional_readings">
                                        <p>text of paragraph here</p>

                                    </div>
                                    <div type="web_links">
                                        <p>text of paragraph here</p>
                                        <p>other paragraphs would follow</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                    <p>text of paragraph here</p>
                                    <p>other paragraphs would follow</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </egXML>
                    </p>
                    <p>This structure may be useful to encode only those types of chapters that fit
                        within it (for instance, the chapters of a particular course handbook),
                        while it will be completely unsuited for those types of documents that do
                        not respect this kind of composition. It follows that a scholar who uses XML
                        to encode her texts of interest has to concentrate on the structural
                        organisation of these texts and therefore on those textual features which
                        are directly relevant to her study and purposes of analysis.</p>
                    <p>However, the process of making explicit a structure which is claimed to exist
                        implicitly is not an easy task. First of all, the texts that need to be
                        encoded in XML may already exist in a format which is particularly hard to
                        re-mediate. A good example is for instance a print dictionary. When we
                        browse it for looking up a word, we are not necessary aware of its
                        structure, of the fact that different chunks of text in an entry may bear
                        different meanings and functions. But if we want to produce an XML document
                        which expresses the structure of a typical page of this dictionary, we would
                        need to analyse the dictionary and make explicit all those elements that on
                        a print page may <emph>look</emph> the same.</p>
                    <p>Once the document analysis (i.e. the identification of the meaningful
                        constituents of a text for XML encoding purposes) is done and the XML
                        document has been produced in a more or less definite form, every kind of
                        search based on the document structure can be performed, a multiple display
                        can be arranged, the document can be re-purposed for different media and
                        formats, its data can be re-used and exchanged. In a way, the difficulties
                        of expressing a document structure in XML are paid back by the potential
                        advantages of carrying out further processing with it, such as producing
                        sophisticated deliveries and advanced combinatorial search based on the
                        structure of the text<note>To give a very simple example, if in a text
                            containing both prose and poem, both lines of verses and lines of prose
                            are encoded in XML, it will be possible to search specific occurrences
                            of text within prose or poem separately, if needed and if meaningful for
                            specific research questions.</note>.</p>
