        <head>Introduction</head>

        <p>This document defines an XML format for the structure of the data
        which all ENRICH partners will contribute to the Manuscriptorium,
        either directly or indirectly by means of a harvester or
        transformation process. The schema is a conformant subset of Release 1.1.0
        of TEI P5. </p>

        <p>The schema defined by this document addresses three distinct
        aspects of a digitized manuscript:
        <list rend="ordered">
          <item>metadata describing the original source manuscript (<ptr target="#msdesc"/>) </item>
          <item>metadata describing digitized images of the original source
          manuscript (<ptr target="#facs"/>) </item>
          <item>a transcription of the text contained by the original source
          manuscript <!--(<ptr target="#transcr"/>) --></item>
        </list>
        </p>

        <p>Within Manuscriptorium, only the first two are required. However,
        the schema documented here also provides for the third, in the
        interest of completeness and for the assistance of ENRICH partners
        wishing to provide richer access facilities to  their holdings. </p>

        <p>The schema defined by this document is available in DTD, RELAX NG,
        and W3C Schema languages, downloadable from the address <ptr target="http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ENRICH/ODD/RomaResults/"/>. A PDF
        version of the present document (300 pages) is also available from 
        <ptr target="http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ENRICH/Deliverables/referenceManual.pdf"/>;
        this forms one of the key deliverables for Work Package 3 of the ENRICH project. </p>


        <p>The MASTER and MASTER-X specifications both defined comparatively
        unconstrained XML formats, which permitted a very wide range of
        possibilities and did not attempt to constrain (for example)
        values to any predefined set of values. While appropriate for an
        interchange format, this approach has some drawbacks. 
        <list>
          <item>there may be wide variation in approaches taken to represent
          essentially the same phenomenon (e.g.)</item>
          <item>the format appears over complex to novice users, who will only
          ever want to use a very small subset of the possible tags</item>
          <item>developing software (e.g. stylesheets) for the format becomes
          unnecessarily complex, since every possibility must be allowed for
          even though it is unlikely to appear</item>
          <item>accurate searching of the data may be needlessly complicated by
          the large number of ways of representing e.g. attribute values such as
          dates</item>
        </list>
        </p>
        <p>In the ENRICH schema  the number of choices
        and the possible values of several attributes to have been
        considerably constrained. Nevertheless, 
        <list>
          <item>the resulting schema  remains fully  TEI Conformant: we are only
          defining a subset</item>
          <item>all constraints introduced have the full consent of all
          partners in the project</item>
        </list>
        </p>

        <p>The overall structure of an ENRICH-conformant XML document may be
        summarized as follows:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <TEI>
            <teiHeader>
              <!-- ... metadata describing the manuscript  -->
            </teiHeader>
            <facsimile>
              <!-- ... metadata describing the digital images -->
            </facsimile>
            <text>
              <!-- (optional) transcription of the manuscript -->
            </text>
          </TEI>

        </egXML>

        </p>

        <p>The remainder of this document describes each of these aspects in
        more detail, using material derived from the P5 release of the TEI
        Guidelines.</p>

      </div>

      <div type="div2" xml:id="msdesc">

        <head>Manuscript Description Metadata</head>

        <p>Each distinct manuscript must be described using a distinct
        TEI-conformant <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, as specified in the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html">TEI
        Guidelines, chapter 2</ref>. This
        element may contain many components, depending on the needs of the
        creator, which may be provided in either structured or (relatively)
        unstructured form. For Manuscriptorium purposes, the following
        components of the TEI Header <emph>must</emph> be provided, and
        <emph>must</emph> conform to the constraints specified here.
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="fileDesc"/>
          <specDesc key="titleStmt"/>
          <specDesc key="publicationStmt"/>
          <specDesc key="sourceDesc"/>
          <specDesc key="revisionDesc"/>
        </specList>
        </p>

        <p>Other header components, if present, will be ignored by
        Manuscriptorium; they will be retained for storage in the system and
        returned on request, but their content is not processed for any
        purpose, including access.</p>



        <p>The following example shows the minimal required structure:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <teiHeader>
            <fileDesc>
              <titleStmt>
                <title>[Title of manuscript]</title>
              </titleStmt>
              <publicationStmt>
                <distributor>[name of data provider]</distributor>
                <idno>[project-specific identifier]</idno>
              </publicationStmt>
              <sourceDesc>
                <msDesc xml:id="ex5" xml:lang="en"> <!-- [full manuscript description ]--></msDesc>
              </sourceDesc>
            </fileDesc>
            <revisionDesc>
              <change when="2008-01-01">
                <!--  [revision information] -->
              </change>
            </revisionDesc>
          </teiHeader>
        </egXML>
        </p>
        <p>Taking these in turn,
        <list>

          <item>the title of the manuscript is used to identify it in short
          summary displays; it should correspond with the information used for
          the same purpose in the <gi>head</gi> element within the
          <gi>msDesc</gi> element below.</item>

          <item>the name of the data provider may be given in any conventional
          form but should be consistent across all data provided.</item>

          <item>the project-specific identifier has two parts: it consists of
          the short alphabetic code used to identify the partner (e.g. OCS for
          OUCS), followed by a four digit sequence number. For example,
          <code>OCS0002</code> would be the second digital record contributed to
          the Manuscriptorium project by partner OCS. Note that this identifier
          has nothing to do with the manuscript shelfmark or other
          identifier. When ingesting records, Manuscriptorium will assume that
          if a record with this identifier already exists, the intention is to
          replace it.</item>

          <item>the manuscript description provided must follow the
          specification given in the remainder of this section.</item>

          <item>at least one <gi>change</gi> element must be provided, providing
          the date that this record was last revised before being submitted. As
          elsewhere, dates must be provided in the ISO format
          <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code>. The content of the <gi>change</gi> element
          is free text, which may be used to indicate the scope of any revision
          and the person/s responsible for it. </item>
        </list>
        </p>

        <p>
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="msDesc" atts="xml:id xml:lang"/>
          </specList>
          
          The <gi>msDesc</gi> element is used to provide detailed information
          about a single manuscript. For ENRICH purposes, this must carry the
          attributes mentioned above, to supply a unique internal identifier for the
          manuscript, and to specify the language of its description
        respectively. </p>
        <p>The value for <att>xml:id</att> may be the same as the value
        supplied for the <gi>idno</gi> element in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, or
        it may be some other project-specific identifier used for
        cross-reference. It should however be prefixed by an identifier for
        the partner concerned, so as to avoid possible identifier
        collisions. </p>
        <p>The value for <att>xml:lang</att>, as elsewhere, must be supplied
        in the form of a valid language identifier (see below). If no value is
        supplied, the assumption is that the language of the description is
        English.</p>
        <p>The <gi>msDesc</gi> element  has the following component elements,
        each of which is further described in the
        remainder of this section. 
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="msIdentifier"/>
          <specDesc key="msContents"/>
          <specDesc key="physDesc"/>
          <specDesc key="history"/>
          <specDesc key="additional"/>
          <specDesc key="msPart"/>
        </specList>
        </p>

        <p>The first of these components, <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, is mandatory;
        it is described in more detail in <ptr target="#msid"/> below. It is
        followed by either one or more paragraphs, marked up as a series of
        <gi>p</gi> elements, or one or more of the specialized elements
        <gi>msContents</gi> (<ptr target="#msco"/>), <gi>physDesc</gi> (<ptr target="#msph"/>), <gi>history</gi> (<ptr target="#mshy"/>), and
        <gi>additional</gi> (<ptr target="#msad"/>).  These elements are all
        optional, but if used they must appear in the order given here.
        Finally, in the case of a composite manuscript, a full description may
        also contain one or more <gi>msPart</gi> elements (<ptr target="#mspt"/>).</p>


        <p>To demonstrate the variety of records which may be produced,
        consider the following sample manuscript description, chosen more or
        less at random from the Bodleian Library's <title level="m">Summary
        catalogue</title>
        <figure>
          <graphic width="450px" url="images/MSadda61.png"/>
          <head>Entry for Bodleian MS. Add. A. 61 in Madan et al.
          1895-1953</head>
        </figure>
        </p>

        <p>The simplest way of digitizing this catalogue entry would simply be
        to key in the text, tagging the relevant parts of it which make up
        the mandatory <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element, as follows:

        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <msDesc xml:id="ex4" xml:lang="en">
            <msIdentifier>

              <altIdentifier type="former">

            a few coloured capitals.</p>
            <p>'Hic incipit Bruitus Anglie,' the De origine et gestis Regum

          </msDesc>
        </egXML>
        With a suitable stylesheet, this encoding would be as readable as the
        original; it would not, however, be very useful for search purposes
        since only shelfmarks and other identifiers are distinguished by the markup. To
        improve on this, one might wrap the paragraphs in the appropriate
        special-purpose first-child-level elements of <gi>msDesc</gi> and use
        some additional phrase-level elements:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        Such an encoding allows the user to search for such features as title,
        material, and date and place of origin; it is also possible to
        distinguish quoted material and Latin material from descriptive
        passages and to search within distinct parts of the description, for
        example, the manuscript history as distinct from its materials.</p>
        
        <p>This process could be continued further, restructuring the whole
        entry so as to take full advantage of many more  encoding
        possibilities:

          <head>Phrase-level Elements</head>
          <p>Phrase-level elements are XML elements that can appear at the same
          hierarchic level as text in many parts of the digital
          record. Some of these are specialized, in that they may be used only
          within particular contexts; others may be used in any context (see <ptr target="#globalphrase"/>).

          Within the components of the <gi>msDesc</gi> element, the
          following specialized phrase level elements are available:

          <specList>
            <specDesc key="catchwords"/>
            <specDesc key="dimensions"/>
            <specDesc key="heraldry"/>
            <specDesc key="locus"/>
            <specDesc key="material"/>
            <specDesc key="watermark"/>
            <specDesc key="origDate"/>
            <specDesc key="origPlace"/>
            <specDesc key="secFol"/>
            <specDesc key="signatures"/>
          </specList>
          </p>

          <div type="div3" xml:id="msdates">
            <head>Origination</head>
            <p>The following elements may be used to provide information about the
            origins of any aspect of a manuscript:
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="origDate"/>
              <specDesc key="origPlace"/>
            </specList>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>origDate</gi> and <gi>origPlace</gi> elements are
            used to indicate  the date and
            place of origin of a manuscript or manuscript part. Such information
            will usually appear  within the <gi>history</gi> element,
            discussed in section <ptr target="#mshy"/>, but can also appear within
            other parts of the  manuscript description, such as its decoration or
            binding, when these are not of the same date as the manuscript
            itself. Both these elements are members of the
            <ident type="class">att.editLike</ident> class, from which they inherit the
            following attributes:
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="att.editLike" atts="cert resp evidence"/>
            </specList>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>origDate</gi> element is a member of the <ident type="class">att.datable</ident> class, and may thus also carry the
            following attributes: <specList>
            <specDesc key="att.datable.w3c" atts="notBefore notAfter when from to"/>
          </specList>
            </p>

          </div>
          <div type="div3" xml:id="msmat">
            <head>Material</head>
            <p>The <gi>material</gi> element can be used to tag any specific term
            used for the physical material of which a manuscript (or binding, seal, etc.)
            is composed.
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="material"/>
            </specList>
            </p>
            <p>The element may appear wherever a term regarded as significant by
            the encoder occurs, as in the following example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <binding>
                <p>Brown <material>calfskin</material>, previously with two clasps.</p>
              </binding>
            </egXML>

            </p>
          </div>
          <div type="div3" xml:id="mswat">
            <head>Watermarks and Stamps</head>
            <p>Two further elements are provided to
            mark up other decorative features characteristic of manuscript leaves and
            bindings:
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="watermark"/>
              <specDesc key="stamp"/>
            </specList>
            </p>
            <p>These elements may appear
            wherever a term regarded as significant by the encoder occurs. The
            <gi>watermark</gi> element is most likely to be of use within the
            <gi>support</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#msph1sup"/>
            below. We give a simple example here: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <support>
              <material>Rag
              paper</material> with <watermark>anchor</watermark>
            watermark</support>
          </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>stamp</gi> element will typically appear when text from the source
            is being transcribed, for example within a rubric in the following case:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <rubric>Apologyticu TTVLLIANI AC IGNORATIA IN XPO IHV<lb/>

              <lb/>
              </rubric>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>It may also appear as part of the detailed description of a binding:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <binding>
                <p>Modern calf recasing with original armorial stamp <stamp>Ex
                Bibliotheca J. Richard D.M.</stamp>
                </p>
              </binding>
            </egXML>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div type="div3" xml:id="msdim">
            <head>Dimensions</head>
            <p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element can be used to specify the size of
            some aspect of the manuscript.
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="dimensions" atts="type"/>
            </specList>
            </p>

            <p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element will normally occur within the
            element describing the particular feature or aspect of a manuscript
            whose dimensions are being given; thus the size of the leaves would be
            specified within the <gi>support</gi> or <gi>extent</gi> element (part
            of the <gi>physDesc</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#msph1"/>),
            while the dimensions of other specific parts of a manuscript, such as
            accompanying materials, binding, etc., would be given in other parts
            of the description, as appropriate. </p>
            <p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>dimensions</gi> element is
            used to specify more exactly the item being measured. For ENRICH
            purposes, this attribute must take one of the following values:
            <val>leaf</val>,
            <val>binding</val>,
            <val>slip</val>,
            <val>written</val>,
            <val>boxed</val>. </p>
            <p>The following three elements are available within the <gi>dimensions</gi> element:
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="height"/>
              <specDesc key="width"/>
              <specDesc key="depth"/>
            </specList>
            Each of these elements, if present, must be given in the order
            specified.</p>
            <p>These three elements, as well as <gi>dimensions</gi> itself, are
            all members of the <ident type="class">att.dimensions</ident> class,
            and thus all carry the following attributes: <specList>
            <specDesc key="att.dimensions"
                      atts="extent unit quantity atLeast atMost min max scope">
            </specDesc>
          </specList>
            </p>
            <p>Attributes <att>min</att>,  <att>max</att>, and <att>scope</att> are used only when the
            measurement applies to several items, for example the size of many or
            all the leaves in a manuscript; attributes <att>atLeast</att> and
            <att>atMost</att> are used when the measurement applies to a single
            item, for example the size of a  specific codex,  but has had to be
            estimated. Attribute <gi>quantity</gi> is used when the measurement
            can be given exactly, and applies to a single item; this is the usual
            situation.  The units in which dimensions are measured should always
            be specified using the <att>unit</att> attribute, which will normally
            be taken from a closed set of values appropriate to the project, using
            standard units of measurement wherever possible. In the ENRICH project
            the  following values are permitted:
            <val>cm</val>, 
            <val>mm</val>,
            <val>in</val>,
            <val>line</val>,
            <val>char</val>. If the only data available for the measurement uses
            some other unit, or it is preferred to normalize it in some other way,
            then it may be supplied as a string value using the
            <att>extent</att> attribute.
            </p>
            <p>The content of these elements, if present, simply copies the way
            that the measurement is presented in some source text; it may be
            omitted.
            </p>
            <p>In the simplest case, only the <att>extent</att> attribute may be
            supplied: 
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <width extent="6 cubit">six cubits</width>
            </egXML> 
            More usually, the measurement will be normalised into a value 
            and an appropriate SI unit: 
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <width quantity="270" unit="cm">six cubits</width>
            </egXML>
            Where the exact value is uncertain, the attributes <att>atLeast</att>
            and <att>atMost</att> may be used to indicate the upper and lower
            bounds of an estimated value:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <width atLeast="250" atMost="300" unit="cm">six cubits</width>
            </egXML>
            </p>

            <p>It is often convenient to supply a measurement which applies to a
            number of discrete observations: for example, the number of ruled
            lines on the pages of a manuscript (which may not all be the same), or
            the diameter of an object like a bell, which will differ depending
            where it is measured. In such cases, the <att>scope</att> attribute
            may be used to specify the observations for which this measurement is
            applicable:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <height unit="lines" scope="most" atLeast="20"/>
            </egXML>
            This indicates that most pages have at least 20 lines. The attributes
            <att>min</att> and <att>max</att> can also be used to specify the possible
            range of values: for example, to show that  all pages have between 12 
            and 30 lines: 
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <height unit="lines" scope="all" min="12" max="30"/>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element may be repeated as often as
            necessary, with appropriate attribute values to indicate the nature
            and scope of the measurement concerned. For example, in the following
            case the leaf size and ruled space of the leaves of the manuscript are
            specified:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <dimensions type="written" unit="mm">
                <height scope="most" quantity="90" unit="mm"/>
                <width scope="most" quantity="48" unit="mm"/>
              </dimensions>
              <dimensions type="leaf">
                <height min="157" max="160" unit="mm"/>
                <width quantity="105" unit="mm"/>
              </dimensions>
            </egXML>
            This indicates that for most leaves of the manuscript being described
            the ruled space is 90 mm high and 48 mm wide, while the leaves throughout 
            are between 157 and 160 mm in height and 105 mm in width.</p>

            <head>References to Locations within a Manuscript</head>
            <p>The <gi>locus</gi> element is a specialized form of the <gi>ref</gi> element.
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="locus" atts="from to scheme"/>
            </specList>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>locus</gi> element is used to specify the location in the
            manuscript occupied by the element within which it appears. It should
            be supplied  as the first component of an <gi>msItem</gi> element, or of any of the more specific elements appearing within one
            (see further section <ptr target="#msco"/> below, in order to  specify the location of that item within the manuscript being
            described.</p>
            <p>A <gi>locus</gi> element can be used to identify any reference to
            one or more folios within a manuscript, wherever such a reference is
            appropriate. Locations are conventionally specified as a sequence of
            folio or page numbers, but may also be a discontinuous list, or a
            combination of the two. This specification should be given as the
            content of the <gi>locus</gi> element, using the conventions
            appropriate to the individual scholar or holding institution, as in
            the following example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <msItem n="1">
                <locus>ff. 1-24r</locus>
                <title>Apocalypsis beati Ioannis Apostoli</title>
              </msItem>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>A normalized form of the location can also be
            supplied, using special purpose attributes on the <gi>locus</gi>
            element, as in the following revision of the above example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <msItem n="1">
                <locus from="1r" to="24r">ff. 1-24r</locus>
                <title>Apocalypsis beati Ioannis Apostoli</title>
              </msItem>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>If a digital image is available for the locus described by the
            <gi>locus</gi> element, then the  <att>facs</att> attribute should be
            used  to  associate it
            with that  image, as in the following example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <decoDesc>
                <p>Several of the miniatures in this section have been damaged and 
                overpainted at a later date (e.g. the figure of Christ on 
                <locus facs="#F33R">fol. 33r</locus>; the face of the 
                Shepherdess on <locus facs="#F59V">fol. 59v</locus>, 
                etc.).</p>
              </decoDesc>
            </egXML>
            Usually, the <att>facs</att> attribute  points
            directly to a <gi>surface</gi> element within the <gi>facsimile</gi>
            element associated with the manuscript description, as further
            discussed in section <ptr target="#facs"/> below. It is also possible,

            <p>Where a manuscript contains more than one foliation, the
            <att>scheme</att> attribute may be used to distinguish them. For
            example, MS 65 Corpus Christi College, Cambridge contains two fly
            leaves bearing music. These leaves have modern foliation 135 and
            136 respectively, but are also marked with an older foliation. This
            may be preserved in an encoding such as the following:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <locus scheme="#original">XCIII</locus>
              <locus scheme="#modern">135</locus>
              </egXML> Here the <att>scheme</att> attribute points to a
              <gi>foliation</gi> element providing more details about the scheme
            used, as further discussed in <ptr target="#msphfo"/> below.</p>
          </div>
          <div type="div3" xml:id="msnames">
            <head>Names of Persons, Places, and Organizations</head>
            <p>The standard TEI element <gi>name</gi> may be used to identify
            names of any kind occurring within a description:
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="name" atts="type"/>
            </specList>
            As further discussed in <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONARS"/>, this element is a member of
            the TEI class <ident type="class">att.canonical</ident>, from which it
            inherits the  following attributes:
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="att.canonical" atts="key ref"/>
            </specList>
            </p>
            <p>Here are some examples of the use of the <gi>name</gi> element:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <name type="person">Thomas Hoccleve</name>
              <name type="place">Villingaholt</name>
              <name type="org">Vetus Latina Institut</name>
              <name type="person" ref="#HOC001">Occleve</name>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>Note that the <gi>name</gi> element is defined as providing
            information about a <emph>name</emph>, not the person, place, or organization to which that name refers. In the last example above, the <att>ref</att> attribute is used to
            associate the name with a more detailed description of the person
            named. This is provided by means of the <gi>person</gi> element, which
            is also available in the ENRICH schema. An element such as the following might then be used to provide
            detailed information about the person indicated by the name:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <person xml:id="HOC001" sex="1">
                <persName>
                  <surname>Hoccleve</surname>
                  <forename>Thomas</forename>
                </persName>
                <birth notBefore="1368"/>
                <occupation>poet</occupation>
                <!-- other personal data -->
              </person>
            </egXML>

            <!--<specList>
                <specDesc key="person"/>
                </specList>-->
            Note that an instance of the 
            <gi>person</gi> element must be provided for each distinct
            <att>ref</att> value specified. In the example above, the value
            <val>HOC001</val> must be found as the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of
            some <gi>person</gi>; the same
            value will be used as the <att>ref</att> attribute of every reference
            to Hoccleve in the document (however spelled), but there will only be
            one <gi>person</gi> element with this identifier.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, the <att>key</att> attribute may be used to supply
            an identifying code for the person referenced by the name
            independently of both the existence of  a <gi>person</gi> element and
            the use of the standard URI reference mechanism. If, for example, a
            project maintains as its authority file some non-digital resource, or
            uses  a database which cannot readily be
            integrated with other digital resources for this purpose, the unique
            codes used by such <soCalled>offline</soCalled> resources may be used
            as values for the <att>key</att> attribute. Although such practices clearly
            reduce the interchangeability of the resulting encoded texts, they may
            be judged more convenient or practical in certain situations.
            </p>

            <p>All the <gi>person</gi> elements referenced by a particular
            document set should be collected together within a <gi>listPerson</gi>

            element, located in the TEI Header. This functions as a kind
            of prosopography for all the people referenced by the set of
            manuscripts being described, in much the same way as a
            <gi>listBibl</gi> element in the back matter may be used to hold
            bibliographic information for all the works referenced.</p>

            <head>Catchwords, Signatures, Secundo Folio</head>
            <p>The <gi>catchwords</gi> element is used to describe one method by
            which correct ordering of the quires of a codex is ensured. Typically,
            this takes the form of a word or phrase written in the lower margin of
            the last leaf verso of a gathering, which provides a preview of the
            first recto leaf of the successive gathering. This may be a simple
            phrase such as the following:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <catchwords>Quires signed on the last leaf verso in roman numerals.</catchwords>
            </egXML>
            Alternatively, it may contain more details:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <catchwords>Vertical catchwords in the hand of the scribe placed along 
              the inner bounding line, reading from top to bottom.</catchwords>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The <soCalled>Signatures</soCalled> element is used, in a similar
            way, to describe a similar  system in which quires or leaves are
            marked  progressively  in order to facilitate arrangement during
            binding. For example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <signatures>At the bottom of the first four leaves of quires 1-14 are 
              the remains of a series of quire signatures a-o plus roman figures in 
              a cursive hand of the fourteenth century.</signatures>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>signatures</gi> element can be used for either leaf
            signatures, or a combination of quire and leaf signatures, whether the
            marking is alphabetic, alphanumeric, or some ad hoc system, as in the
            following more complex example:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <signatures>Quire and leaf signatures in letters, [b]-v, and roman numerals; 
              those in quires 10 (1) and 17 (s) in red ink and different from others; 
              every third quire also signed with red crayon in arabic numerals in the 
              centre lower margin of the first leaf recto: "2" for quire 4 (f. 19), 
              "3" for quire 7 (f. 43); "4", barely visible, for quire 10 (f. 65), "5", 
              in a later hand, for quire 13 (f. 89), "6", in a later hand, for quire 
              16 (f. 113).</signatures>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>secFol</gi> element (for <soCalled>secundo
            folio</soCalled>) is used to record an identifying phrase (also
            called <foreign>dictio probatoria</foreign>)  taken from a
            specific known point in a codex (for example the first few words on
            the second leaf). Since these words will differ from one copy of
            a text to another, the practice originated in the middle ages of using
            them when cataloguing a manuscript in order to distinguish individual
            copies of a work in a way which its opening words could not.

            <p>Descriptions of heraldic arms, supporters, devices, and mottos may
            appear at various points in the description of a manuscript, usually in the context of ownership
            information, binding descriptions, or detailed accounts of
            illustrations. A full description may also contain a detailed account of the
            heraldic components of a manuscript independently considered. Frequently, however, heraldic descriptions will
            be cited as short phrases within other parts of the record. The phrase
            level element <gi>heraldry</gi> is provided to allow such phrases to

          <head>The Manuscript Identifier</head>
          <p>The <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element is intended to provide an
          unambiguous means of uniquely identifying a particular
          manuscript. This may be done in a structured way, by providing
          information about the holding institution and the call number,
          shelfmark, or other identifier used to indicate its location within
          that institution. Alternatively, or in addition, a manuscript may be
          identified simply by a commonly used name.
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="msIdentifier"/>
          </specList>
          </p>
          <p>A manuscript's actual physical location may occasionally be
          different from its place of ownership; at Cambridge University, for
          example, manuscripts owned by various colleges are kept in the central
          University Library. Normally, it is the ownership of the manuscript which should
          be specified in the manuscript identifier, while additional or more
          precise information on the physical location of the manuscript can be
          given within the <gi>adminInfo</gi> element, discussed in section <ptr target="#msadad"/> below.</p>
          <p>The following elements are available within <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
          to identify the holding institution:
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="country"/>

            <specDesc key="settlement"/>

          </p>
          <p>Only one of each of the elements listed above

          appear in the order given.</p>
          <note rend="query">Should we make country mandatory? </note>
          <p>These elements are all also members of the  attribute class
          <ident type="class">att.naming</ident>, from which they inherit the following
          attribute:

          </specList>
          </p>
          <p>The following elements are used within <gi>msIdentifier</gi> to
          provide different ways of identifying the manuscript within its holding institution:
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="collection"/>
            <specDesc key="idno"/>
            <specDesc key="altIdentifier" atts="type"/>

          </specList>
          </p>
          <p>Major manuscript repositories will usually have a preferred
          form of citation for manuscript shelfmarks, including rules
          about punctuation, spacing, abbreviation, etc., which should be
          adhered to. Where such a format also contains information which might
          additionally be supplied as a distinct subcomponent of the
          <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, for example a collection name,
          a decision must be taken as to whether to use the more specific
          element, or to include such information within the <gi>idno</gi> element. For
          example, the manuscript formally identified as <q>El 26 C 0</q> forms
          a part of the Ellesmere (<q>El</q>) collection. Either of the
          following encodings is therefore feasible:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <msIdentifier>
              <country>USA</country>
              <region type="state">California</region>
              <settlement>San Marino</settlement>
              <repository>Huntington Library</repository>
              <collection>El</collection>
              <idno>26 C 9</idno>
              <msName>The Ellesmere Chaucer</msName>
            </msIdentifier>
          </egXML>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <msIdentifier>
              <country>USA</country>
              <region type="state">California</region>
              <settlement>San Marino</settlement>
              <repository>Huntington Library</repository>
              <idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
              <msName>The Ellesmere Chaucer</msName>
            </msIdentifier>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>In the former example, the preferred form of the identifier can be
          retrieved by prefixing the content of the <gi>idno</gi> element with
          that of the  <gi>collection</gi> element, while in the latter it is
          given explicitly. The advantage of the former is that it it simplifies
          accurate retrieval of all manuscripts from a given collection; the
          disadvantage is that encoded abbreviations of this kind may not be as
          immediately comprehensible. Care should be taken to avoid redundancy:
          for example <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <collection>El</collection>
          <idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
          </egXML> would clearly be inappropriate. Equally clearly, 
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <collection>Ellesmere</collection>
            <idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
            </egXML> might be considered helpful in some circumstances (if, for
            example, some of the items in the Ellsemere collection had shelfmarks
          which did not begin <q>El</q>)</p>
          <p>In cases where the shelfmark  contains no information about the
          collection, it may be necessary to provide this explicitly, as in
          the following example:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <msIdentifier>
              <country>USA</country>
              <region type="state">New Jersey</region>
              <settlement>Princeton</settlement>
              <repository>Princeton University Library</repository>
              <collection>Scheide Library</collection>
              <idno>MS 71</idno>
              <msName>Blickling Homiliary</msName>
            </msIdentifier>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>In these examples, <gi>msName</gi> has been used to provide
          a common name other than the shelfmark by which a manuscript is
          known. Where a manuscript has several such names, more than one of these elements may be used, as in the following
          example:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <msIdentifier>
              <country>Danmark</country>

              <msName xml:lang="is">Fríssbók</msName>
            </msIdentifier>
          </egXML>
          Here the globally available <att>xml:lang</att> attribute has been
          used to specify the language of the alternative names. <!--This is a
          standard TEI facility, which may be found useful in certain

          but will be known by a particular name or names. In such
          circumstances, the <gi>idno</gi> element may be omitted, and the
          manuscript identified by  the name or names used for it, using
          one or more <gi>msName</gi> elements, as in the following example:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <msIdentifier>
              <settlement>Rossano</settlement>
              <repository xml:lang="it">Biblioteca arcivescovile</repository>
              <msName xml:lang="la">Codex Rossanensis</msName>
              <msName xml:lang="la">Codex purpureus</msName> 
              <msName xml:lang="en">The Rossano Gospels</msName> 
            </msIdentifier>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>Where manuscripts have moved from one institution to another, or
          even within the same institution, they may have identifiers additional
          to the ones currently used, such as former shelfmarks, which are
          sometimes retained even after they have been officially superseded. In
          such cases it may be useful to supply an alternative identifier using the
          <gi>altIdentifier</gi> element, which has a detailed structure similar
          to that of the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element, and an additional
          attribute <att>type</att> to indicate what kind of alternative
          identifier this is. Only the following possibilities are envisaged:
          <list type="gloss">
            <label>former</label>
            <item>former catalogue or shelf number</item>

          <p>The following example shows a manuscript which had shelfmark
          <code>II-M-5</code> in the collection of the Duque de Osuna, but which
          now has the shelfmark <code>MS 10237</code> in the National Library in
          Madrid:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <msIdentifier>
              <settlement>Madrid</settlement>
              <repository>Biblioteca Nacional</repository>
              <idno>MS 10237</idno>
              <altIdentifier type="former">

              </altIdentifier>
            </msIdentifier>
          </egXML>
          Alternatively, such information may be dealt with under <gi>history</gi>
          or <gi>adminInfo</gi>, except in
          cases where a manuscript is likely still to be referred to or known by
          its former identifier. 
          <!-- For example, an institution may have changed
               its call number system but still wish to retain a record of the earlier
               number, perhaps because the manuscript concerned is frequently cited in print
               under its previous number:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <msIdentifier>
               <settlement>Berkeley</settlement>
               <institution>University of California</institution>
               <repository>Bancroft Library</repository>
               <idno>UCB 16</idno>
               <altIdentifier type="former"><idno>2MS BS1145 I8</idno></altIdentifier>
               </msIdentifier>
               </egXML>
               Where (as in this example) no repository is specified for the
               <gi>altIdentifier</gi>, it is assumed to be the same as that of the
               parent <gi>msIdentifier</gi>. Where the holding institution has only
               one preferred form of citation but wishes to retain the other for
               internal administrative purposes, the secondary could be given within
               <gi>altIdentifier</gi> with an appropriate value on the
               <att>type</att> attribute:
               <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <msIdentifier>
               <settlement>Oxford</settlement>
               <repository>Bodleian Library</repository>
               <idno>MS. Bodley 406</idno>
               <altIdentifier type="former"><idno>2297</idno></altIdentifier>
               </msIdentifier>
               </egXML>
               It might, however, be preferable to include such information within
               the <gi>adminInfo</gi> element discussed in section <ptr
               target="#msadad"/> below.-->
          </p>

          <p>Cases of such changed or alternative identifiers should be clearly
          distinguished from cases of <soCalled>scattered</soCalled>
          manuscripts, that is to say manuscripts which although physically
          disjoint are nevertheless generally treated as single units. One
          well-known example is the Old Church Slavonic manuscript known as
          <title>Codex Suprasliensis</title>, substantial parts of which are to
          be found in three separate repositories, in Ljubljana, Warsaw, and
          St. Petersburg. This should be represented using three distinct
          <gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements, using the value <val>partial</val> on the
          type attribute to indicate that these three identifiers are not
          alternate ways of referring to the same physical object, but three
          parts of the same entity.

          <p>As mentioned above, the smallest possible description is one that
          contains only the element <gi>msIdentifier</gi>; good practice in all
          but exceptional circumstances requires the presence within it of the
          three sub-elements <gi>settlement</gi>, <gi>repository</gi>, and
          <gi>idno</gi>, since they provide what is, by common consent, the

        <!--
            <div type="div2" xml:id="msdo">
            <head>The Manuscript Heading</head>
            <p>Historically, the briefest possible meaningful description of a
            manuscript consists of no more than a title,
            e.g. <mentioned>Polychronicon</mentioned>. This will often have been
            enough to identify a manuscript in a small collection because the
            identity of the author is implicit. Where a title does not imply the
            author, and is thus insufficient to identify the main text of a
            manuscript, the author should be stated explicitly
            (e.g. <mentioned>Augustinus, Sermones</mentioned> or <mentioned>Cicero,
            Letters</mentioned>). Many inventories of manuscripts consist of no
            more than an author and title, with some form of copy-specific
            identifier, such as a shelfmark or <soCalled>secundo folio</soCalled> reference
            (e.g. <mentioned>Arch. B. 3. 2: Evangelium Matthei cum
            glossa</mentioned>, <mentioned>126. Isidori Originum libri
            octo</mentioned>, <mentioned>Biblia Hieronimi, 2o fo. opus
            est</mentioned>); information on date and place of writing will
            sometimes also be included. 
            The standard TEI element <gi>head</gi>
            element can be used to provide a brief description of this kind.
            <specList>
            <specDesc key="head"/>
            </specList>
            In this way the cataloguer or scholar can supply in one place a
            minimum of essential information, such as might be displayed or
            printed as the heading of a full description. </p>
            <p>For ENRICH purposes, a <gi>head</gi> element is required, and must
            contain the following summary elements:
            <specList>
            <specDesc key="author"/>
            <specDesc key="title"/>
            <specDesc key="origDate"/>
            <specDesc key="origPlace"/>
            </specList>

For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<head><author>Marsilius de Inghen</author>, <title>Abbreviata phisicorum Aristotelis</title>; <origPlace>Italy</origPlace>, <origDate>1463</origDate>.</head>
</egXML>

Any phrase-level elements, such as <gi>title</gi>, <gi>name</gi>,
<gi>date</gi>, or the specialized elements <gi>origPlace</gi> and
<gi>origDate</gi>, can also be used within a <gi>head</gi> element,
but it should be remembered that the <gi>head</gi> element is intended
principally to contain a heading. More
structured information concerning the contents, physical form, or
history of the manuscript should be given within the specialized
elements described below, <gi>msContents</gi>, <gi>physDesc</gi>,
<gi>history</gi>, etc. However, in simple cases, the <gi>p</gi>
element may also be used to supply an unstructured collection of
such information, as in the example given above (<ptr target="#msdesc"/>.
</p>
<p>A manuscript may often contain multiple works by multiple
authors. The <gi>head</gi> element should only be used to provide 
summary information:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<head><author>Hildegard of Bingen</author> et alii, <title>Opera varia</title>; <origPlace>Heidelberg</origPlace>, <origDate>1455</origDate>.</head>
</egXML>
which should be supported by a more detailed description using the
<gi>msContents</gi> element described in the next section.</p>

        <div type="div2" xml:id="msco">
          <head>Intellectual Content</head>
          <p>The <gi>msContents</gi> element is used to describe the
          intellectual content of a manuscript or manuscript part. It comprises
          <emph>either</emph> a series of informal prose paragraphs
          <emph>or</emph> a series of <gi>msItem</gi> 
          elements, each of which provides a more detailed description of a
          single item contained within the manuscript. These may be prefaced, if
          desired, by a <gi>summary</gi> element, which is especially useful
          where one wishes to provide an overview of a manuscript's contents and
          describe only some of the items in detail.
          <specList>
            <specDesc key="msContents"/>

          <p>In the simplest case, only a brief description may be provided, as

          <gi>title</gi>, <gi>bibl</gi>, or <gi>list</gi>. More usually,

            following extra elements may be found useful to transcribe relevant
            details from the original titlepage:
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="docAuthor"/>
              <specDesc key="docTitle"/>
              <specDesc key="docImprint"/>
            </specList>
            These elements are also available within the <gi>msItem</gi> element.
            </p>


            <p>In addition,<!-- a <gi>msItemStruct</gi> may contain nested
            <gi>msItemStruct</gi> elements, just as--> an <gi>msItem</gi> may contain
            nested <gi>msItem</gi> elements.</p>
            <!--<p>The main difference between <gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi> is
                that in the former, the order and number of child elements is not
                constrained; any element, in other words, may be given in any order,
                and repeated as often as is judged necessary. In the latter, however, the
                sub-elements, if used, must be given in the order specified above and
                only some of  them may be repeated; specifically,  <gi>rubric</gi>,
                <gi>finalRubric</gi>.  <gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>textLang</gi> and
                <gi>explicit</gi> can appear only once.</p>
                <p>While  neither
                <gi>msItem</gi> nor <gi>msItemStruct</gi> -->
            <p>Untagged running
            text is not permitted directly within an <gi>msItem</gi>, unless it is
            given within a <gi>p</gi> element, in which case 
            none of the other component elements listed above is permitted.
            </p>
            <p>The elements <gi>msContents</gi>, <gi>msItem</gi>,
            <!--<gi>msItemStruct</gi>, --><gi>incipit</gi>, and <gi>explicit</gi> are all
            members of the class <ident type="class">att.msExcerpt</ident> from

            <specList>
              <specDesc key="att.msExcerpt" atts="defective"/>
            </specList>
            This attribute can be used for example with collections
            of fragments, where each fragment is given as a separate
            <gi>msItem</gi> and the first and last words of each fragment are transcribed as
            defective incipits and explicits <!--, as in the following example, a
            manuscript containing four fragments of a single work:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <msContents>

            selected. Similarly, the <gi>g</gi> element used in this example to
            represent the abbreviation mark is defined by the <ident type="module">gaiji</ident> module documented in chapter <ptr target="#WD"/>-->. </p>

          <div type="div3" xml:id="msat">
            <head>Authors and Titles</head>
            <p>When used within a manuscript description, the <gi>title</gi> element should be used to supply a regularized
            form of the item's title, as distinct from any rubric quoted from the
            manuscript. If the item concerned has a standardized distinctive
            title, e.g. <mentioned>Roman de la Rose</mentioned>, then this should
            be the form given as content of the <gi>title</gi> element, with the
            value of the <att>type</att> attribute given as
            <code>uniform</code>. If no uniform title exists for an item, or none
            has been yet identified, or if one wishes to provide a general
            designation of the contents, then a <soCalled>supplied</soCalled>
            title can be given, e.g. <mentioned>missal</mentioned>, in which case
            the <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>title</gi> should be given
            the value <code>supplied</code>.</p>

            <p>Similarly, if used within a manuscript description, the
            <gi>author</gi> element should always contain the normalized form of
            an author's name, irrespective of how (or whether) this form of the
            name is cited in the manuscript. If it is desired to retain the form
            of the author's name as given in the manuscript, this should be given
            in the <gi>docAuthor</gi> element, or  as
            a distinct <gi>name</gi> element, within the text at the point where
            it occurs. </p>
            <!-- an example would be nice here -->
            <p>Note that the <att>key</att> or <att>ref</att> attributes can be
            used, on titles and on author names as on names in general, to link
            the name to a more detailed description of the person or work
            concerned (see further <ptr target="#msnames"/>).</p>
            <p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element can be used to supply the name and role of a person other than the author who is responsible for some aspect of the intellectual content of the manuscript:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <author>Diogenes Laertius</author>
              <respStmt>
                <resp>in the translation of</resp>
                <name type="person">Ambrogio Traversari</name>
              </respStmt>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>resp</gi> element is also a member of the
            <ident>att.canonical</ident> class, from which it inherits the
            <att>key</att> attribute. For ENRICH purposes, this may be used to
            supply a standard relationship code for the kind of
            responsibility concerned, as defined in the
            list maintained at <ptr target="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html"/>:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <respStmt>
                <resp key="trl">přeložil</resp>
                <name type="person">John Enrich</name>
              </respStmt>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element can also be used where there is a discrepancy between the author of an item as given in the manuscript and the accepted scholarly view, as in the following example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <title type="supplied">Sermons on the Epistles and the Gospels</title>
              <respStmt>
                <resp>here erroneously attributed to</resp>
                <name type="person">St. Bonaventura</name>
              </respStmt>
            </egXML>
            Note that such attributions of authorship, both correct and incorrect, are frequently found in the rubric or final rubric (and occasionally also elsewhere in the text), and can therefore be transcribed and included in the description, if desired, using the <gi>rubric</gi>, <gi>finalRubric</gi>, or <gi>quote</gi> elements, as appropriate.

            <head>Rubrics, Incipits, Explicits, and Other Quotations from the Text</head>
            <p>It is customary in a manuscript description to record the opening
            and closing words of a text as well as any headings or colophons it
            might have, and the specialised elements <gi>rubric</gi>,
            <gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>explicit</gi>, <gi>finalRubric</gi>, and

            along with the more general <gi>quote</gi>, for recording other bits of
            the text not covered by these elements. Each of these elements has the
            same substructure, containing a mixture of phrase-level elements and
            plain text. A <gi>locus</gi> element can be included within each, in
            order to specify the location of the component, as in the following
            example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

            Note here also the use of the <att>defective</att> attribute on <gi>incipit</gi> and <gi>explicit</gi> to indicate that the text begins and ends defectively.
            </p>

            <p>The <gi>textLang</gi> element should be used to provide
            information about the languages used within a manuscript item. It may take
            the form of a simple note, as in the following example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <textLang mainLang="chu">Old Church Slavonic, written in Cyrillic script.</textLang>

            </p>

            <specGrp xml:id="spec2">
              <elementSpec ident="textLang" mode="change" module="msdescription">

                  <attDef ident="mainLang" mode="change" usage="req"/>
                </attList>
              </elementSpec>
            </specGrp>

            <p>For validation and indexing purposes, the <att>mainLang</att>
            attribute muse be supplied:  it takes
            the same range of values as the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute,
            on which see further <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CH.html#CHSH"/>. 
            When a manuscript item  contains material in more than one language, the
            <att>mainLang</att> attribute should be used only for the chief language. 
            Other languages used may be specified using the <att>otherLangs</att>
            attribute as in the following example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <textLang mainLang="chu" otherLangs="RUS HEL">Mostly Old Church 
              Slavonic, with some Russian and Greek material</textLang>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>Since Old Church Slavonic may be written in either
            Cyrillic or Glagolitic scripts, and even occasionally in both within the
            same manuscript, it might be preferable to use a more explicit
            identifier:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <textLang mainLang="chu-Cyrs">Old Church Slavonic in Cyrillic script</textLang>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The form and scope of language identifiers recommended by these
            Guidelines is based on the IANA standard described at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/html/CH.html#CHSH"/> and
            should be followed throughout. Where additional detail is needed
            correctly to describe a language, or to discuss its deployment in a
            given text, this should be done using the <gi>langUsage</gi> element
            in the TEI Header, within which individual <gi>language</gi> elements
            document the languages used: see <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD41"/>.  </p>
            <p>Note that the <gi>language</gi> element defines a particular
            combination of human language and writing system. Only one
            <gi>language</gi> element may be supplied for each such
            combination. Standard TEI practice also allows this element to be
            referenced by any element using the global <att>xml:lang</att>
            attribute in order to specify the language applicable to the content
            of that element. For example, assuming that <gi>language</gi>
            elements have been defined with the identifiers <ident>fr</ident> (for
            French), <ident>la</ident> (for Latin), and <ident>de</ident> (for
            German), a manuscript description written in French which specifies
            that a particular manuscript contains predominantly German but also
            some Latin material, might
            have a <gi>textLang</gi> element like the following:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <textLang xml:lang="fr" mainLang="de" otherLangs="la">allemand et latin</textLang>

          useful in the description of a given manuscript. These include:
          <list>
            <item>aspects
            of the form, support, extent, and quire structure of the manuscript
            object and of the way in which the text is laid out on the page (<ptr target="#msph1"/>);</item>
            <item>the styles of writing, such as the way it is laid out on the
            page, the styles of writing, decorative features, any musical notation
            employed and any annotations or marginalia (<ptr target="#msph2"/>);</item>
            <item> and discussion of its binding, seals, and any
            accompanying material (<ptr target="#msph3"/>).</item>
          </list>
          </p>
          <p>Most manuscript descriptions touch on several of these categories
          of information though few include them all, and not all distinguish
          them as clearly as we propose here. In particular, it is often the
          case that an existing description will include within a single
          paragraph, or even
          sentence, information for which
          we propose distinct elements. In this case, if rewriting is not an option, the
          existing prose must be marked up simply as a series of <gi>p</gi> elements,
          directly within the <gi>physDesc</gi> element.</p>
          <p>The <gi>physDesc</gi> element may thus be used in either of two
          distinct ways. It may contain a series of paragraphs addressing topics
          listed above and similar ones. Alternatively, it may act as a container for any
          choice of the more specialized elements described in the remainder of
          this section, each of which itself contains a series of paragraphs,
          and may also have more specific attributes. If the two ways
          are  combined in a single description, care should be taken to avoid
          duplication and all paragraphs of generic description must precede the first
          of the more specialised elements.</p>
          <div type="div3" xml:id="msph1">
            <head>Object Description</head>
            <p>The <gi>objectDesc</gi> element is used to group together those
            parts of the physical description which relate specifically to the
            text-bearing object, its format, constitution, layout, etc. The
            <att>form</att> attribute is used to indicate the specific type of
            writing vehicle being described: it must be supplied, and its
            value must be one of <val>codex</val>, <val>scroll</val>,
            <val>leaf</val>, or <val>other</val>. If no value is
            supplied, the value <val>codex</val> will be assumed.

            The <gi>objectDesc</gi> element has two parts: a description of the
            <term>support</term>, i.e. the physical carrier on which the text is
            inscribed; and a description of the <term>layout</term>, i.e. the way
            text is organized on the carrier.</p>
            <p>Taking these in turn, the description of the support is tagged
            using the following elements, each of which is discussed in more
            detail below:
            <specList>
              <specDesc key="supportDesc" atts="material"/>
              <specDesc key="support"/>

              <specDesc key="foliation"/>
              <specDesc key="condition"/>
            </specList>
            </p>
            <p>Each of these elements contains paragraphs relating to the topic
            concerned. Within these paragraphs, phrase-level elements (in
            particular those discussed above at <ptr target="#msphrase"/>),
            may be used to tag specific terms of interest if so
            desired.</p>
            <p>The <att>form</att> attribute on <gi>supportDesc</gi> is used to
            summarize briefly the materials used for the support. For ENRICH
            purposes, it must have one of the following values:
            <val>perg</val> (parchment), 
            <val>chart</val> (paper), 
            <val>mixed</val>, <val>unknown</val>.

            <p>Here is a simple example:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
              <objectDesc form="codex">
                <supportDesc material="mixed">

                  <watermark>ox</watermark> (close to <ref>Briquet 2785</ref>). 
                  The first and last leaf of each quire, with the exception of 
                  quires xvi and xviii, are constituted by bifolia of parchment, 
                  and all seven miniatures have been painted on inserted 
                  singletons of parchment.</p>
                </supportDesc>

            </egXML>
            </p>

            <p>This example combines information which might alternatively be more
            precisely tagged using the more specific elements described in the
            following subsections.</p>
            <div type="div4" xml:id="msph1sup">
              <head>Support</head>
              <p>The <gi>support</gi> element groups together information about the
              physical carrier. Typically, for western manuscripts, this will entail
              discussion of the material (parchment, paper, or a combination of the
              two) written on. For paper, a discussion of any watermarks present may
              also be useful.  If this discussion makes reference to standard
              catalogues of such items, these may be tagged using the standard
              <gi>ref</gi> element as in the following example:

              <p>The <gi>extent</gi> element, defined in the TEI header, may also be
              used in a manuscript description to specify the number of

              <p>The <gi>collation</gi> element should be used to provide a

              commentaries, etc. This may be given as a simple series of
              paragraphs. Alternatively, one or more different layouts may be
              identified within a single manuscript, each described by its own
              <gi>layout</gi> element.

                <specDesc key="layoutDesc"/>
                <specDesc key="layout"/>
              </specList>
              </p>
              <p>Where the <gi>layout</gi> element is used, the layout will often be
              sufficiently regular for the attributes on this element to convey all
              that is necessary; more usually however a more detailed treatment will
              be required. The attributes are provided as a convenient shorthand for
              commonly occurring cases, and should not be used except where the
              layout is regular. The value <code>NA</code> (not-applicable) should
              be used for cases where the layout is either very irregular, or where
              it cannot be characterized simply in terms of lines and columns, for
              example, where blocks of commentary and text are arranged in a regular
              but complex pattern on each page</p>
              <p>The following examples indicate the range of possibilities:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <layout ruledLines="25 32" columns="1">
                  <p>Most pages have between 25 and 32 long lines ruled in lead.</p>
                </layout>
                <layout columns="1" writtenLines="24">
                  <p>Written in one column throughout; 24 lines per page.</p>
                </layout>
                <layout columns="1">
                  <p>Written in a single column, with 8 lines of text and interlinear glosses in 
                  the centre, and up to 26 lines of gloss in the outer two columns. Double 
                  vertical bounding lines ruled in hard point on hair side. Text lines ruled 
                  faintly in lead. Remains of prickings in upper, lower, and outer (for 8 lines 
                  of text only) margins.</p>
                </layout>
              </egXML>
              </p>
              <p>Note that if (as in the last example above) no value is given for
              the <att>columns</att> attribute, the assumption is that there is a
              single column of writing on each page.

              <p>The <gi>handDesc</gi> element can contain a short description of
              the general characteristics of the writing observed in a manuscript,
              as in the following example:

              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <handDesc>
                  <p>Written in a <term>late Caroline minuscule</term>; versals in a 
                  form of <term>rustic capitals</term>; although the marginal and 
                  interlinear gloss is written in varying shades of ink that are 
                  not those of the main text, text and gloss appear to have been 
                  copied during approximately the same time span.</p>
                </handDesc>
              </egXML>
              </p>
              <p>Note the use of the <gi>term</gi> element to mark specific technical
              terms within the context of the <gi>handDesc</gi> element.</p>
              <p>Where several distinct hands have been identified, this fact can be registered by using the <att>hands</att> attribute, as in
              the following example:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <handDesc hands="2">
                  <p>The manuscript is written in two contemporary hands, otherwise
                  unknown, but clearly those of practised scribes. Hand I writes
                  ff. 1r-22v and hand II ff. 23 and 24. Some scholars, notably
                  Verner Dahlerup and Hreinn Benediktsson, have argued for a third hand
                  on f. 24, but the evidence for this is insubstantial.</p>

              the <gi>handNote</gi> element should

              <val>minor</val>.</p>

              <p>If early printed material or incunables are described using this
              schema, the <gi>typeDesc</gi> and <gi>typeNote</gi> elements may be
              used (in the same way as <gi>handDesc</gi> and <gi>handNote</gi>) to
              record information about the typefaces etc. of interest in the source.
              <!-- example needed --> 
              Both <gi>typeDesc</gi> and <gi>handDesc</gi> may be supplied, for
              example in the case where a printed work has been annotated by a
              number of hands. </p>

              <p>The <gi>locus</gi> element, discussed in
              section <ptr target="#msloc"/>, may be used to specify which parts of a
              manuscript are written by a given hand.</p>

              <p>In addition, when a full or partial transcription of a manuscript
              is available in addition to the manuscript description, the
              <gi>handShift</gi> element described in <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHDH"/>
              can be used to link the relevant parts of the transcription to the
              appropriate <gi>handNote</gi> or <gi>typeNote</gi> element in the
              description: for example, at the point in the transcript where the
              second hand listed above starts (i.e. at folio 72v:4), we might insert
              <code>&lt;handShift new="#Eirsp-2"/&gt;</code>.</p>
              <p>No <gi>typeShift</gi> element is proposed; if it is felt
              inappropriate to use <gi>handShift</gi> for this purpose, the generic
              <gi>mileStone</gi> may be used.

              <p>It can be difficult to draw a clear distinction between aspects of
              a manuscript which are purely physical and those which form part of
              its intellectual content. This is particularly true of illuminations
              and other forms of decoration in a manuscript. We propose the
              following elements for the purpose of delimiting discussion of these
              aspects within a manuscript description, and for convenience locate
              them all within the physical description, despite the fact that the
              illustrative features of a manuscript will in many cases also be seen
              as constitutiing part of its intellectual content.</p>
              <p>The <gi>decoDesc</gi> element may contain simply one or more
              paragraphs summarizing the overall nature of the decorative features
              of the manuscript, as in the following example:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <decoDesc>
                  <p>The decoration comprises two full page miniatures, perhaps added 
                  by the original owner, or slightly later; the original major decoration
                  consists of twenty-three large miniatures, illustrating the divisions of 
                  the Passion narrative and the start of the major texts, and the major 
                  divisions of the Hours; seventeen smaller miniatures, illustrating the 
                  suffrages to saints; and seven historiated initials, illustrating
                  the pericopes and major prayers.</p>
                </decoDesc>
              </egXML>
              Alternatively, it may contain a series of more specific typed
              <gi>decoNote</gi> elements, each summarizing a particular aspect or
              individual instance of the decoration present, for example the use of
              miniatures, initials (historiated or otherwise), borders, diagrams,
              etc. The scope of the description is indicated by the <att>type</att>

                  <p>The text of this manuscript is not interpolated with sentences from 
                  Royal decrees promulgated in 1294, 1305 and 1314. In the margins, however, 
                  another somewhat later scribe has added the relevant paragraphs of these 
                  decrees, see pp. 8, 24, 44, 47 etc.</p>
                  <p>As a humorous gesture the scribe in one opening of the manuscript, pp. 36 
                  and 37, has prolonged the lower stems of one letter f and five letters þ 
                  and has them drizzle down the margin.</p>

                  <locus>10r</locus> and <locus>11r</locus>. Although a few of these chapter headings are

              <p>The circumstance may arise where material not originally part of a

              <gi>msPart</gi> element (see <ptr target="#mspt"/> below).  There are,
              however, cases where the additional matter is not self-evidently a
              distinct manuscript: it might, for example, be a set of notes by a
              later scholar, or a file of correspondence relating to the
              manuscript. The <gi>accMat</gi> element is provided as a holder for

              <p>The <gi>recordHist</gi> element may contain either a series of

              similar way to the standard TEI <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element within a
              TEI Header. If the record is a new one, made without reference to
              anything other than the manuscript itself, then it may be omitted, or
              simply contain a <gi>p</gi> element, as in the following example:

              <p>Frequently, however, the record will be derived from some
              previously existing description, which may be specified using the

              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

          </facsimile>
        </egXML>
        </p>
        <p>The <att>xml:base</att> attribute specifies the <soCalled>root
        URL</soCalled>, which will be prefixed to all URL values within the
        child elements of this <gi>facsimile</gi>. </p>
        <p>This example defines only two pages. There are three images
        associated with the first page, which is
        represented by the <gi>surface</gi> element with
        unique identifier <val>LSB-1r</val>, and two with  the second, which has no
        identifier. Each image is represented by means of a TEI
        <gi>graphic</gi> element. </p>
        <p>As well as acting as a container for the various images associated
        with a page, the <gi>surface</gi> element defines an abstract
        co-ordinate system which may be used when defining additional zones of
        interest on the page. In this example, the location of an initial
        letter on the page is defined, since we have a graphic representing
        this detail. The zone within which the initial letter falls is in the
        box defined by the co-ordinates (20,20,70,70) within a grid defined by
        the co-ordinates (0,0,200,300). Thus, if the surface depicted
        actually measured 200 by 300 mm, the initial letter would occupy a
        50 X 50 mm square, with its upper left corner located 20 mm from the
        left and 20 mm from the top edges of the surface. Note however that
        the numbers used to express co-ordinates are not measurements in any
        specific units and should not be used to determine the actual image
        size, since these may in any case vary greatly: in our example, the
        first image is a full page scan, while the second is a thumbnail.</p>
        <p>The <att>mimeType</att> attribute is used to indicate the format of
        the graphic file itself, and may be any valid MIME type, as defined by
        the IANA, for example <val>jpeg</val>, <val>png</val>, <val>bmp</val>,
        <val>tiff</val> etc. </p>
        <p>The <att>decls</att> attribute is used to indicate an external URI
        from which further metadata applicable to this image may be found. In
        this case we are assuming that there is a definition which can be used
        to indicate characteristics of a thumbnail image at the address
        indicated. Note that this must be given in full, since it would
        otherwise be interpreted as an address relative to the value of the
        <att>xml:base</att> attribute on the parent <gi>facsimile</gi>.</p>
        <note rend="query">Alternatively, should we invent a type-like attribute
        which could be validated in the schema? </note>
        <p>The <gi>desc</gi> element within a <gi>zone</gi> may be used to
        supply additional information about that zone, in this example to
        describe what it contains. In the TEI scheme, full documentation  of a
        facsimile and its contents is carried in other parts of the digital
        document, linked to it in either or both of the following ways:
        <list>
          <item>the <att>start</att> attribute may be used on a <gi>zone</gi> or
          <gi>surface</gi>; it points to an element in the transcription the
          start of which coincides with the zone or surface concerned.</item>
          <item>the <att>facs</att> attribute may be used, for example on the
          <gi>msContents</gi> or <gi>msItem</gi> element in a manuscript
          description, or on any element in the transcription, to point to the
          <gi>surface</gi> bearing the start of the matter in question. </item>
        </list>
        </p>
        <p>To complete the above example, we might thus expect that the
        <gi>msDesc</gi> for this manuscript will contain something like the
        following:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <msItem>
            <locus facs="#LSB-1r">ff. 1r-1v</locus>
            <title>Ludovícuss saga Bernharðssonar</title>
          </msItem>
        </egXML>
        Here, the value of the <att>facs</att> attribute is a
        pointer to the <gi>surface</gi> element corresponding with the part of
        the manuscript in which the <gi>msItem</gi> specified begins.

        If a transcription of this (regrettably nonexistent) manuscript exists,
        then it might begin as follows:

        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <div facs="#LSB-1r">
            <pb n="1r"/>
            <p>Maðr hét Ludovícus, sonr Bernharðs greifa, er kallaðr var loðinbjörn.
            <!-- rest of text for page one -->
            <pb n="1v" xml:id="LSB-1v"/>
            <!-- text for second page here -->

        </egXML>
        pointer to the <gi>surface</gi> element corresponding with the part of
        the manuscript at which the transcribed text begins.
