<figDesc>SANE Sponsors</figDesc> </figure> September 30th 2004 saw the
opening of the 4th International System Administration and Network
Engineering Conference (SANE) at Amsterdam's RAI conference
centre. The conference was organized by the Netherlands UNIX User
Group (NLUUG), co-sponsored by Stichting NLnet, with cooperation from
USENIX, the Advanced Computing Systems Association.</p>
<p>A SANE conference has been held every two years since the first
was organized in 1998 <q>...to strengthen the European ties between
the National UNIX User Groups and their members</q>, in the spirit of
the former EUUG/EurOpen. I had attended SANE 2000, held in
Maastricht, so was delighted to receive an invitation from NLUUG to
represent UKUUG at SANE 2004.</p>

<p>The conference itself was preceded by three days of tutorials -
a very strong programme with five parallel streams throughout the
three days. Topics ranged from networking (IPv6, firewalls,
wireless, IP telephony), through operating systems (FreeBSD 5.2
code walkthrough, Linux 2.6 process management), to popular
applications (MySQL, Postfix, OpenLDAP, Samba). Every SANE
conference has also featured a Black Hats Session, which is
obviously popular: this year's ("Black Hats Session IV:
Developments in Security") was run on Monday and repeated on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Work pressures prevented me from attending the tutorials, but I
arrived at RAI on Wednesday evening just as Richard Stallman was
finishing his presentation, <q>The Danger of Software Patents</q>.
Stallman had travelled to Amsterdam earlier in the day and joined
in the demonstration for innovation without software patents held
in Amsterdam's Dam Square. The demonstration was organized to
coincide with a high-level EU conference on future ICT policy in
Europe (initiated by the Dutch government in their 2004 Presidency
of the EU), also being held in Amsterdam. Enough politics (for
now). <figure rend="alignleft" url="http://www.softwarepatenten.be/gallery/dam6r-260.jpg">

           </figure>
        </p>

<p>Wednesday evening also saw the SANE Free Software Bazaar, a free
event open to non-delegates. Here you could meet and chat
informally with developers from the Debian project, OpenBSD,
FreeBSD, CAcert, and many others. Birds-of-a-feather sessions
covering Samba, KDE, MMBase, KeyWorx, and VIM were also held on
Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>The conference proper started on Thursday morning with a keynote
by Paul Kilmartin of eBay, Inc, <q>eBay through the eyes of the
Systems Administrator</q>. This was a very interesting talk about the
challenges of managing the IT infrastructure behind a (rapidly)
growing company, where downtime means losing real money (eBay
currently transacts business worth more than USD 1000/second). The
most important point I came away with was this: when you are
planning for high availability, you do not want to be at the
bleeding edge, you want to be doing what other HA sites are doing.
Unfortunately for eBay, this is not always possible: they are,
after all, one of the world's largest online retailers.</p>

<p>Another important point from Kilmartin's talk was that they are
never under the illusion of having solved a problem: while a new
system might handle today's workload, eBay's growth is such that
the lifetime of any solution is strictly limited. Kilmartin ended
his talk with a section entitled <q>Why I Hate Vendors</q>. Anyone who
has dealt with a vendor support desk more interested in closing a
trouble ticket than actually solving a problem will have a lot of
sympathy with him.</p>

<p>After the keynote, the conference split into two streams:
refereed papers, and invited speakers. I stayed with the invited
speakers for the rest of the morning.</p>

<p>The first of these was Arjen Lentz of MySQL AB, with <q>MySQL
Roadmap - What we have now and where we are heading</q>. He covered
some history of the MySQL project, their development procedures and
release schedule, and MySQL's current (and planned) features.
Whenever he was talking about a feature, he said a few words about
the developer behind it: their background, where they are in the
world, and how they came to be involved with the project. This
added a personal dimension to what might otherwise have been a dull
list of features, and also emphasized the global bazaar nature of
MySQL development.</p>

<p>Next was Wietse Venema's <q>Open Source Security Lessons</q>. He
began his talk with some history, taking us back to the time when
Eindhoven University in the Netherlands was first connected to the
Internet. One <q>unofficial</q> user of their systems was causing
problems for system administrators: they cleaned up after their
activities with <q>rm -rf /</q>. In an effort to track down this
intruder, Venema wrote the first version of what we now know as
"TCP wrappers".</p>

<p>He went on to talk about the press response to his and Dan
Farmer's release of SATAN, the network security vulnerability
scanner: <q>It's like distributing high-powered rocket launchers
throughout the world, free of charge, available at your local
library or school</q> (San Jose Mercury). As it turned out, the
release of SATAN did not result in an increase in reports of
computer break-in activity, and SATAN proved a useful addition to
the system administrator's toolbox for many years.</p>

<p>He then talked about Postfix, and the role its release had in
bringing open source software to the attention of IBM's senior
management. Finally, he came to the debate about open versus closed
source software and security, where he thinks the protagonists are
missing the point: <q>...when a system isn't built to be secure, then
it will be like Swiss cheese no matter how many security patches
you apply</q>. He pointed out that this is not a new insight, and
quoted a 30-year-old paper saying essentially the same thing.</p>

<p>After lunch, I moved to the other lecture room for the refereed
papers: <q>Lambda Networking in NetherLight</q> by Erik Radius of
SURFnet; then <q>Traffic shaping for large-scale web services</q> by
Angelos Varvitsiotis of the Greek Research and Technology
Network.</p>

<p>The first of these was a technical talk about using different
wavelengths of light (lambdas) to transmit multiple data channels
over a single optical fibre (dense wavelength division
multiplexing). As well as the technical aspects, Radius talked
about NetherLight's global connectivity (which includes StarLight
in Chicago, and UKLight in London), and potential uses for the
technology (for example, high-bandwidth GRID computing).</p>

<p>From high bandwidth to low: Varvitsiotis's talk was about
traffic shaping for web servers with an uplink bottleneck. He used
an Apache module, mod_mimetos, to set the IP type-of-service value
according to the MIME type, file size, directory, etc. of the
content being delivered, in conjunction with a class-based queuing
(CBQ) scheme and a set of filters to map ToS values to particular
queues, implemented using the Linux kernel's advanced routing and
traffic control mechanisms. He also updated Apache's mod_mime_magic
module to bring it into line with the latest <q>file</q> code.</p>

<p>Varvitsiotis then used data gathered from his University's cache
logs to generate driver data for a simulation, and ran different
workloads against an uplink-throttled web server. The results of
these experiments are detailed in his paper.</p>

<p>The next refereed paper, <q>TCG 1.2 - fair play with the Fritz
chip?</q>, was presented by Rudiger Weis of Vrije University. This was
an entertaining (but nevertheless worrying) look at the latest
proposal from Microsoft and other members of the Trusted Computing
Group (TCG).</p>

<p>The concept of trusted computing is to place an especially
trusted observer, or <q>Fritz chip</q>, into information-handling
devices, to prevent even the device owner from carrying out certain
operations: the owner gives up some control of their device in
return for the ability to verify a device's <q>trustworthiness</q>.</p>

<p>While the proposed architecture will offer only limited
protection against worms and viruses, it offers a lot of features
that can be used to protect a personal computer against its owner,
especially in the field of Digital Restrictions Management (in the
words of Ron Rivest, <q>...you are putting a virtual set-top box
inside your PC. You are essentially renting out part of your PC to
people you may not trust</q>).</p>

<p>Cryptographers and privacy organizations have pressurized the
TCG into modifying their proposals, and the recent TCG 1.2
specification does address some of their concerns. There are,
however, still worries about backdoors, potential compatibility
problems between Trusted Computing and Free (GPL-licensed)
Software, and patent issues (an official Microsoft statement reads
"...Much of the next-generation secure computing base architecture
design is covered by patents, and there will be intellectual
property issues to be resolved. It is too early to speculate on how
those issues might be addressed.").</p>

<p>The final talk of the day was a choice between the invited
speaker, John Nelson on <q>Special Effects on the Movie 'I, Robot'</q>,
and Clifford Wolf's refereed paper on <q>Distributed Software
Development using Subversion and SubMaster</q>. I opted for the
latter.</p>

<p>
            <figure rend="alignright" url="http://www.nluug.nl/gallery/conference/sane2004/images/20040929-190638.jpg">

           </figure>
        </p>

<p>Some of you will already know Clifford Wolf as the project
leader for ROCK Linux. Just over a year ago, the ROCK Linux project
decided to switch from CVS to Subversion. In the first half of his
talk, Wolf covered the basics of revision control systems and
introduced Subversion itself. He then moved on to discuss
SubMaster, and it was here that the talk started to get
interesting.</p>

<p>Like CVS, Subversion is a centralized revision control system,
where only privileged project members have commit access to a
central repository. Other developers must submit patches via a
mailing list, where they can easily be overlooked.</p>

<p>SubMaster, developed by the ROCK Linux project, is an attempt to
address this problem and provide for a distributed development
model. SubMaster provides scripts that make it easy for developers
to create and manage their own branches (in their own local
Subversion repository), keep them synchronized with the central
repository, and send patches upstream. It also provides a CGI
script to manage patch submission, collect feedback, make
regression tests, and apply patches to the main tree.</p>

<p>But a conference is about more than just technical talks, and
SANE is no exception. There are opportunities to chat informally
with peers during the refreshment breaks, but there's nothing like
being thrown together on a boat with an unlimited supply of beer to
break the ice.</p>

<p>The SANE 2004 social event on Thursday evening began as
something of a mystery tour, with three <q>bendy busses</q> setting off
across the city, attempting a three-point turn on a dual
carriageway, then dropping us in the middle of nowhere. After a
short walk through a residential then industrial area, we arrived
at a boat yard and boarded a boat for the evening's cruise.
Entertainment was provided by the Bucket Big Band (I counted seven
saxophones, a clarinet, trombone, two trumpets, two guitars, a
drummer, and a very energetic conductor). As well as unlimited
drinks, a buffet provided plenty of Indonesian food, making for a
very enjoyable evening. Better still, by the time we docked, the
bus drivers had found the boat yard, so there was no need to repeat
the walk.</p>

<p>The first invited speaker on Friday morning was Geoff Halprin of
The SysAdmin Group, with <q>The Changing Face of System
Administration</q>. Halprin discussed the challenges facing modern-day
system administrators and the often conflicting priorities:
troubleshooting, user support, infrastructure projects, keeping our
skills up-to-date. He stressed the importance (to system
administrators as well as managers) of measuring how much time is
spent on each of task, and of maintaining the correct balance
(learning and infrastructure projects should not lose out to
short-term objectives).</p>

<p>I switched to the refereed papers stream for the next two talks,
"High Available Loadsharing with OpenBSD" by Marco Pfatschbacher,
then <q>Deployment of Worldwide IDS Networks</q> by Matthias Hofherr.
Both of these speakers work for GeNUA mbH, a German IT security
consultancy.</p>

<p>Pfatschbacher presented a paper describing work carried out as
part of his diploma thesis about High Availability VPNs. In a
traditional load balancing setup, the load balancer is a single
point of failure unless a second, redundant, load balancer is
introduced. As with many HA solutions, this introduces extra
complexity. Pfatschbacher came up with a nifty idea to provide HA
and load balancing without this complexity.</p>

<p>He implemented a new kind of network interface in OpenBSD, a
virtual Ethernet interface, or veif. The veif can be assigned an
arbitrary MAC address, effectively providing two network interface
cards in one. Thus two hosts on the same network can share a common
MAC and IP address without changing the MAC addresses of their
physical interfaces. Each host remains individually addressable,
while packets sent to the common address are seen by both
hosts.</p>

<p>Of course, this presents problems on a switched network, so his
next trick is to make a switch behave like a hub. To achieve this,
veif never sends any packets with its virtual MAC as a source
address (think proxy ARP), so the switch never learns the
whereabouts of the common MAC address.</p>

<p>The next step is to ensure that, although all packets are seen
by both hosts, each packet is only processed by one host.
Pfatschbacher introduced an option to OpenBSD's pf to filter
packets based on a hash of the source and destination IP addresses
and ports. One host is configured to drop all packets in one half
of the hash space, and the other host to drop all packets in the
opposite half.</p>

<p>OpenBSD 3.5 introduced support for CARP (Common Address
Redundancy Protocol), which utilizes virtual MAC addresses to
enable multiple machines on the same local network to share a set
of IP addresses, while ensuring that these addresses are always
available. Pfatschbacher used CARP for monitor and failover of the
pf-hash configuration: if one host fails, its hash range is
migrated to one of the remaining CARP hosts.</p>

<p>In the next talk, <q>Deployment of worldwide IDS networks</q>,
Hofherr presented a case study featuring a fictional company,
BigCorp, who wanted to employ a network intrusion detection system
in their offices across the globe.</p>

<p>Hofherr described a hierarchical solution, with IDS sensors
analyzing traffic and generating alerts that are fed upstream to a
"Central". The sensors and the central communicate over a dedicated
management network, both to lessen the burden on the production
network, and to reduce the likelihood of an attacker analyzing the
IDS data. The solution was based on the open source IDS Snort, with
a central server running PostgreSQL. Administration is over https
to an Apache server, using client certificates for
authentication.</p>

<p>Hofherr discussed the different possibilities for traffic
capture, their chosen solution (Ethernet Tap devices), the problems
this introduced for Snort (and how they solved them), and the
protocol for communication between the sensors and central servers.
He also discussed security, availability, and monitoring of the IDS
infrastructure itself.</p>

<p>He concludes that, although installation of a single network
intrusion detection system is well understood and documented,
implementing a distributed IDS presents new problems. While there
are no out-of-the-box open source solutions, the software
components do exist and the challenge is in coming up with a
robust, secure, and conclusive design.</p>

<p>A meeting of national Unix User Group board members had been
called for Friday lunchtime. The Netherlands (NLUUG), Norway
(NUUG), Denmark (DKUUG), United Kingdom (UKUUG), and Croatia
(HrOpen) were all represented here. Discussion focused on how the
national groups might work together, for example, reciprocal
agreements enabling members to attend national UUG events at the
local members' rate. DKUUG is planning to revitalize the defunct
EUUG/EurOpen and put the content of old EUUG magazines online, and
NUUG has digital video footage of some of its talks available.</p>

<p>It was interesting to meet with the other UUG board members and
to see the common challenges we are facing. The meeting engendered
an excellent spirit of cooperation, and I came away feeling quite
optimistic. The challenge remains in turning ideas into concrete
actions, and following through on those actions.</p>

<p>I returned to the invited speakers for the remainder of the
conference. This stream started off after lunch with a talk on
"Dutch Law Enforcement vs High Tech Crime" by Pascal Hetzscholdt, a
policy advisor to the Dutch National Police Agency. Hetzscholdt is
currently involved in setting up a High Tech Crime Centre in the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>
<figure rend="alignleft" url="http://www.nluug.nl/gallery/conference/sane2004/images/20040928-100906.jpg">
               <figDesc>Lecture</figDesc>
           </figure> He talked about
the challenges faced by the police in tackling the new <q>cyber
crime</q>, and the links between high tech crime (phishing, fraud) and
organized gangs often involved in drug trafficing and arms trading.
These links can make it hard to decide which agency should tackle
the problem: fraud investigators, because of the financial aspects
of phishing? <q>cybercops</q> for their technical expertise? drug
enforcement agencies when the money is used for drug
trafficing?</p>

<p>Fighting IT crime is not seen as a <q>cool thing</q> - sitting in
front of a computer screen is not as exciting as a high-speed car
chase. And shouldn't priority be given to more shocking crimes like
murder, rape, kidnapping? In the Netherlands, these priorities are
decided by the public prosecutor who often does not recognize the
significance of computer crime, but knows that it can be costly to
find the IT expertise required to fight it.</p>

<p>Hetzscholdt appealed to the system administrators and Internet
service providers in the audience for their help: the police need
our expertise. But he was not given an easy time during audience
questioning: many are unhappy with legal requirements imposed on
ISPs to collect logs and data about their users activities and meet
the costs of storing this for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Next came my favourite talk of the conference, Sjoera Nas of
Bits of Freedom on <q>The Multatuli Project: ISP Notice &amp; Take
Down</q>. Under the European directive on electronic commerce,
Internet service providers risk liability for hosting apparently
illegal content from their customers. This is quite different from
the situation in the United States, where the DMCA provides a safe
harbour for service providers.</p>

<p>In 2003, three researchers from the Oxford Centre for
Socio-Legal Studies conducted a small experiment with notice and
take-down, to see if the different legal frameworks made any
difference in practice. They published an article (an extract from
John Stuart Mill's <q>On Liberty</q>, about freedom of speech) on a
homepage in the UK and one in the USA. This was clearly marked as
dating from 1869, and belonging to the public domain.</p>

<p>They then sent a fake complaint to the two ISPs, using an
anonymous Hotmail address. The UK provider removed the homepage
within 24 hours, while the US provider insisted that the
complainant declare they were acting in good faith (this is one of
the safe harbour provisions in the DMCA). Not wanting to risk the
next (fraudulent) step, the researchers stopped there.</p>

<p>Bits of Freedom organized a similar experiment this summer,
involving ten Dutch ISPs. They uploaded some text by the famous
author Multatuli (Eduard Douwes Dekker), dating from 1871. Again,
their homepage clearly attributed the text and stated that it was
in the public domain.</p>

<p>Seven of the ten providers took down the homepage, one within 3
hours of receiving the fake complaint. Only one provider showed any
distrust about the origin of the complaint, and only one
demonstrated that they had actually looked at the page in question.
In one case, the customer was not even informed of the complaint,
and in another, the customer's personal details were forwarded to
the complainant. Two of the ISPs did not reply at to the email sent
to their official abuse addresses.</p>

<p>Nas concludes <q>It only takes a Hotmail account to bring a
website down, and freedom of speech stands no chance in front of
the Texan-style private ISP justice</q>.</p>

<p>The final talk of the conference was by Peter H. Salus, the
famous USENIX bookworm. His talk <q>UNIX and the ARPAnet/Internet at
35; Linux a teenager; still in court</q>, gave a historical
perspective on the SCO Group's attack on Linux through the court
system. Salus interspersed his many slides of penguin photos with
copies of legal documents from the SCO Group court cases, giving a
light-hearted view of the proceedings.</p>

<p>Throughout the conference, more than a dozen technical posters
were on display in the lobby: an alternative method for
authentication, authorization and accounting for Windows 2000/XP
systems; PPTP must die; CAcert; and more. The prize for best poster
was awarded to John Borwick of Wake Forest University for his
poster on <q>LDAP for Systems and Network Engineering</q>. This
described a method for storing DNS and DHCP configuration data in
an LDAP database, and using Perl scripts to retrieve the data and
generate configuration files.</p>

<p>There was also a prize for best paper, which was awarded to Luca
Deri for his paper <q>Improving Passive Packet Capture: Beyond Device
Polling</q>. Deri proposes a new approach to passive packet capture
which, combined with device polling, allows packets to be captured
and analyzed at (almost) wire speed on Gbit networks using a legacy
PC.</p>

<p>After presentation of the prizes and thank you's to the many
volunteers who helped to make the conference run so smoothly, Quiz
Master Kevin Henney took over with the inSANE quiz. Two teams were
drawn <q>completely at random</q> from the business cards solicited
earlier in the day, and pitted against each other and the Quiz
Master's <q>completely fair scoring</q>.</p>

<p>You really had to know your geek culture to do well in this quiz
- but that alone was not enough. There was audience participation
too, with each team having to guess how the audience would respond
to <q>yellow or green</q> questions. For example, the Quiz Master would
shout <q>Yellow - Python, Green - Perl</q>, the teams would have to
write down their answers (<q>yellow</q> or <q>green</q>) before the audience
voted by holding coloured cards in the air.</p>

<p>After one team had been eliminated, the three members of the
remaining team contended with each other for prizes of books,
posters and T-shirts. The quiz was a fun way to end a very
enjoyable conference.</p>

          <figDesc>Terminal Room</figDesc>
           </figure> I
was impressed both by the professionalism of the organization, the
quality of the talks, and the smooth running of the event. RAI
offered excellent facilities, and the organizers had provided
wireless networking throughout the conference area, as well as a
terminal room with Internet access for those of us traveling
without laptops.</p>

<p>Congratulations, NLUUG, on another excellent conference! I am
looking forward already to SANE 2006, and heartily recommend it to
anyone else with an interest in network or system administration.
