      <remarks>
        <p>Status information on each deletion is needed rather rarely
	except in critical editions from authorial manuscripts; status
	information on additions is even less common.</p>
        <p>Marking a deletion or addition as faulty is inescapably an
        interpretive act; the usual test applied in practice is the
	linguistic acceptability of the text with and without the
        letters or words in question.</p>
