If the material you are planning to encode matches the following criteria, then TEI simplePrint is for you. If it does not, it may not be. <list><item>You are encoding print material, rather than manuscript: simplePrint provides no way of encoding manuscript features such as correction, deletion, or scribal variation</item><item>You are encoding material from the Early Modern period (i.e., up to the end of the nineteenth century): some of the features for which simplePrint provides encodings are rarely found in modern materials.</item><item>You are encoding material written, broadly speaking, within the Western European tradition, using largely Western European characters. simplePrint does provide facilities for encoding short passages in non Western European languages, but many features needed to cope with Asian or ancient scripts are missing. </item><item>Your intention is to provide a relatively simple encoding for a large amount of material, rather than a rich encoding of a small amount of material: simplePrint is intended to help libraries and archives wishing to go beyond basic digital facsimiles, rather than to support specialist research. It does not, for example, include features for detailed linguistic tagging beyond simple word-level tagging, nor for specialised text types such as dictionaries, historical or biographical databases, etc. </item></list> If your needs go beyond those summarized here, simplePrint may still be a good point of departure, and may be very useful as a basis for the creation of your own TEI customisation. We don't however discuss the creation of a TEI customization in this document: the TEI website provides a number of links to tutorial material and tools which may assist in this process.</p><p>The present document is intended to be generally comprehensible and accessible, but does assume some knowledge of XML (the encoding language used by the TEI), and of the way it is used by the TEI. Further information on both these topics are available from many places, not least the TEI's own web site at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org"/>.</p><p>The TEI simplePrint schema was first elaborated as a part of the TEI Simple project funded by the <ref target="https://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</ref> (2012-2014). The project sought to define a new <soCalled>highly-constrained and prescriptive subset</soCalled> of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines suited to the representation of early modern print materials, a formally-defined set of processing rules which permit modern web applications to easily present and analyze the encoded texts, mapping to other ontologies, and processes to describe the encoding status and richness of a TEI digital text. Its choice of elements reflected the practices followed in the encoding of large-scale literary archives, notably those produced by the Text Creation Partnership. Practice of other comparable archives such as the German Text Archive was also taken into account.</p><p>The most distinctive feature of TEI simplePrint is its use of the TEI Processing Model, which provides explicit and recommended options for the display or processing of every textual element. Programmers developing systems to handle texts encoded with TEI simplePrint do not have to look beyond this when building stylesheets or other components. This greatly reduces the complexity of developing applications that will work reliably and consistently for many users and across large corpora of documents.</p><p>The TEI simplePrint schema and the TEI Processing Model were first defined by a working group led by Martin Mueller (Northwestern University) and Sebastian Rahtz (Oxford University). Major contributions to the project were made by Magdalena Turska (Oxford University), James Cummings (Oxford University), and Brian Pytlik Zillig. The changes to the TEI scheme needed to support the TEI Processing Model were reviewed and approved by the TEI Technical Council for inclusion in release 3.0.0 of TEI P5 in February 2016. The present document was extensively revised and extended by Lou Burnard in July 2016 for submission to the TEI Technical Council. </p></div></front><body><!--  <xi:include href="out/elementList.xml"/> --><div xml:id="Simple-eg"><head>A Short Example</head><p>We begin with a short example. How should we go about transferring into a computer a passage of prose, such as the start of the last chapter of Charlotte Brontë's novel <title>Jane Eyre</title>? We might start by simply copying what we see on the printed page, typing it in such a way that what appears on the screen looks as similar as possible, for example, by retaining the original line breaks, by introducing blanks to represent the layout of the original headings, page breaks, and paragraphs, and so forth. Of course, the possibilities are limited by the nature of the computer program we use to capture the text: it may not be possible for example to reflect accurately the typographic characteristics of our source with all such software. Some characters in the printed text (such as the accented letter <mentioned>a</mentioned> in <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> or the long dash) may not be available on the keyboard; some typographic distinctions (such as that between small capitals and full capitals) may not be readily accessible. Our first attempt tries to mimic the appearance of the former, and simply ignores the latter.</p><p><eg xml:space="preserve">
                                CHAPTER 38

READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-
son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I
went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
  'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic
order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a
remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having
one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned
by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did
stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --
   'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'
   A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,
but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she
basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to
ear.
   'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-
ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he
was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian
name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.
   'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary
this.'
   I put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear
more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time
after, I caught the words --
   'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And
again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
that.'
   I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what
I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and

                 JANE EYRE                      475

Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she
would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she
would come and see me.
   'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I
read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-
moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
grave or mine.'
   How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,
kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-
ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who
live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

The transcribed words are complemented by special flags within angle brackets, called <term>tags</term>, which both characterise and mark the beginning and end of a string of characters. For example, each paragraph is marked by a tag <hi rend="tag">&lt;p&gt;</hi> at its start, and a corresponding <hi rend="tag">&lt;/p&gt;</hi> at its end. We don't elaborate further on the syntax of TEI XML here. <note place="foot">Many introductory tutorials on XML are available on the web, for example at <ptr target="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/"/>. The way the TEI uses XML is fully documented in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html">section v of the TEI Guidelines</ref>; a very basic introduction to TEI XML is also available at <ptr target="http://www.ultraslavonic.info/intro-to-xml"/>. The formal specification of the XML language is at <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml"/>.</note></p><p>Aside from its syntax, it is important to note that this particular encoding represents a set of choices or priorities. We have chosen to prioritize and simplify the representation of the words of the text over the representation of the typographic layout associated with them in this source document. This makes it easier for a computer to answer questions about the words in the document than about its typesetting, reflecting our research priorities. This priority also leads us to suppress end-of-line hyphenation. Conceivably Brontë (or her printer) intended the word <q>honeymoon</q> to appear as <q>honey-moon</q> on its second appearance, though this seems unlikely: our decision to focus on Brontë's text, rather than on the printing of it in this particular edition, makes it impossible to be certain. Similarly, our decision makes it impossible to use this transcription as a means of statistically analysing hyphenation practice. An encoding makes explicit all and only those textual features of importance to the encoder.</p><p>It is not difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this short passage might readily be extended to address other research priorities. For example: <list type="simple"><item>a regularized form of the passages in dialect could be provided; </item><item>footnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be added;</item><item>pointers linking parts of this text to others could be added;</item><item>proper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the surrounding text;</item><item>names could be classified as personal, geographical, or institutional</item><item>detailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance and context could be prefixed to it;</item><item>a linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses, words, etc., could be provided, each unit being associated with appropriate category codes;</item><item>the text could be segmented into narrative or discourse units;</item><item>systematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be included in the encoding, with potentially complex alignment or linkage between the text and the analysis, or between the text and one or more translations of it;</item><item>passages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on other media.</item></list></p><p>In the remainder of this document, we present a number of TEI-recommended ways of supporting these and other encoding requirements. These ways generally involve the application of specific TEI XML elements, selected from the full range of possibilities documented in the TEI <title>Guidelines</title>. Like every other TEI project, TEI Simple proposes a view of the TEI Guidelines. This document defines and documents that view.</p></div><div xml:id="Simple-struc"><head>The Structure of a TEI simplePrint Document</head><p>A TEI-conformant text contains (a) a <term>TEI header</term> (marked up as a <ref target="#TEI.teiHeader">&lt;teiHeader&gt;</ref> element) and (b) one or more representations of a text. These representations may be of three kinds: a transcribed text, marked up as a <ref target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref> element; a collection of digital images representing the text, marked up using a <ref target="#TEI.facsimile">&lt;facsimile&gt;</ref> element; or a literal transcription of one or more documents instantiating the text, marked up using the <gi>sourceDoc</gi> element.</p><p>These elements are combined together to form a single <ref target="#TEI.TEI">&lt;TEI&gt;</ref> element, which must be declared within the TEI <term>namespace</term>, and therefore usually takes the form <hi rend="tag">&lt;TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"&gt;</hi> <note place="foot">A <term>namespace</term> is an XML concept. Its function is to identify the vocabulary from which a group of element names are drawn, using a standard identifier resembling a web address. The namespace for TEI elements is <hi rend="val">http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0</hi></note>.</p><p>Some aspects of the TEI header are described in more detail in section <ptr target="#Simple-header"/>. In what follows, we will focus chiefly on the use of the <ref target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref> element, though we describe one way of using the <ref target="#TEI.facsimile">&lt;facsimile&gt;</ref> element in combination with it or alone in section <ptr target="#Simple-fax"/>. We do not consider the <gi>sourceDoc</gi> element further, since it is mainly used in very specialised applications for which TEI simplePrint would not be appropriate.</p><p>A text may be <term>unitary</term> (a single work) or <term>composite</term> (a collection of single works, such as an anthology). In either case, the text may have optional <term>front</term> or <term>back</term> matter such as title pages, prefaces, appendixes etc. We use the term <term>body</term> for whatever comes between these in the source document. We discuss various kinds of composite text in section <ptr target="#Simple-composite"/> below.</p><p>A unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" valid="feasible"><TEI><teiHeader><!-- [ TEI Header information ]  --></teiHeader><text><front><!-- [ front matter ... ] --></front><body><!-- [ body of text ... ]  --></body><back><!--  [ back matter ...  ] --></back></text></TEI></egXML></p><p>In each of the following sections we include a short list of the TEI <term>elements</term> under discussion, along with a brief description, and in most cases an example of how they are used. Throughout the text, element names are linked to their detailed reference documentation, as given in the TEI Guidelines. Note that most of the examples provided by the reference documentation, and all of the links, are not specific to TEI simplePrint.</p><p>For example, here are the elements discussed so far: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.TEI">TEI</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">TEI document</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a single TEI-conformant document, combining a single TEI header with one or more members of the <ident xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0" xmlns:teix="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" type="class">model.resourceLike</ident> class.

In this section we discuss the elements making up the body of a text. A text must always have a body.</p><div xml:id="divs"><head>Text Division Elements and Global Attributes</head><p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs or similar blocks of text, or these may be grouped together into chapters, sections, subsections, etc. The <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> element is used to represent any such grouping of blocks. <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.div">div</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">text division</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text.</seg><table rend="specDesc"><row><cell rend="Attribute"><hi rend="att">type [att.typed]</hi></cell><cell><seg xml:lang="en">characterizes the element in some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or typology.</seg></cell></row></table></item></list></p><p>The <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute on the <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> element may be used to supply a conventional name for this category of text division in order to distinguish them. Typical values might be <hi rend="val">book</hi>, <hi rend="val">chapter</hi>, <hi rend="val">section</hi>, <hi rend="val">part</hi>, <hi rend="val">poem</hi>, <hi rend="val">song</hi>, etc. TEI simplePrint does not constrain the range of values that may be used here.</p><p>A <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> element may itself contain further, nested, <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref>s, thus mimicking the traditional structure of a book, which can be decomposed hierarchically into units such as parts, containing chapters, containing sections, and so on. TEI texts in general conform to this simple hierarchic model.</p><p>Here as elsewhere the <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute may be used to supply a unique identifier for the division, which may be used for cross references or other links to it, such as a commentary, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#Simple-ptrs"/>. It is good practice to provide an <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute for every major structural unit in a text, and to derive its values in some systematic way, for example by appending a section number to a short code for the title of the work in question, as in the examples below.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or alternatively) a short mnemonic name or number for a division, or any other element. If a conventional form of reference or abbreviation for the parts of a work already exists (such as the book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical citations), the <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute is the place to record it; unlike the identifier supplied by the <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute, it does not need to be unique.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi> attribute may be used to specify the language of the division. Languages are identified by an internationally defined code, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#z636"/> below.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">rendition</hi> attribute may be used to supply information about the rendition (appearance) of a division, or any other element, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#Simple-hilites"/> below. Note that this attribute is used to describe the appearance of the <emph>source</emph> text, rather than the appearance of any intended output when the encoded text is displayed. The two may of course be similar, or identical, but the TEI does not assume or require this.</p><p>These four attributes, <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi>, <hi rend="att">n</hi>, <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi>, and <hi rend="att">rendition</hi> are so widely useful that they are allowed on any element in any TEI schema: they are called <term>global attributes</term>. Other attributes defined in the TEI simplePrint schema are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><p>As noted above, the value of every <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute must be unique within a document. One simple way of ensuring this is to make it reflect the hierarchic structure of the document. For example, Smith's <title>Wealth of Nations</title> as first published consists of five books, each of which is divided into chapters, while some chapters are further subdivided into parts. We might define <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> values for this structure as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" valid="feasible"><body><div xml:id="WN1" n="I" type="book"><div xml:id="WN101" n="I.1" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN102" n="I.2" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><!-- ... --><div xml:id="WN110" n="I.10" type="chapter"><div xml:id="WN1101" n="I.10.1" type="part"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN1102" n="I.10.2" type="part"><!-- ... --></div></div><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN2" n="II" type="book"><!-- ... --></div></body></egXML></p><p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> and <hi rend="att">n</hi> attributes: this is often useful where a canonical reference scheme is used which does not tally with the structure of the work. For example, in a novel divided into books each containing chapters, where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the whole work, rather than within each book, one might use a scheme such as the following: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" valid="feasible"><body><div xml:id="TS01" n="1" type="volume"><div xml:id="TS011" n="1" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="TS012" n="2" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div></div><div xml:id="TS02" n="2" type="volume"><div xml:id="TS021" n="3" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="TS022" n="4" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div></div></body></egXML> Here the work has two volumes, each containing two chapters. The chapters are numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> values specified allow them to be regarded additionally as if they were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p></div><div xml:id="h25"><head>Headings and Closings</head><p>Every <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> may have a title or heading at its start, and (less commonly) a trailer such as <q>End of Chapter 1</q> at its end. The following elements may be used to transcribe them: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.head">head</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">heading</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains any type of heading, for example the title of a section, or the heading of a list, glossary, manuscript description, etc.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.trailer">trailer</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a closing title or footer appearing at the end of a division of a text.</seg></item></list> Some other elements which may be found at the beginning or ending of text divisions are discussed below in section <ptr target="#h52"/>.</p><p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a transcription is a matter for the individual transcriber to decide. Where a heading is completely regular (for example <q>Chapter 1</q>) or may be automatically constructed from attribute values (e.g. <hi rend="tag">&lt;div type="chapter" n="1"&gt;</hi>), it may be omitted; where it contains otherwise unrecoverable text it should always be included. For example, the start of Hardy's <title>Under the Greenwood Tree</title> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div xml:id="UGT1" n="Winter" type="part"><div xml:id="UGT101" n="1" type="chapter"><head>Mellstock-Lane</head><p>To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree ... </p></div></div></egXML></p></div><div xml:id="vedr"><head>Textual Components</head><p>In prose texts such as the Brontë example above, the divisions are generally composed of paragraphs, represented as <ref target="#TEI.p">&lt;p&gt;</ref> elements, though in some circumstances it may be preferred to use the <soCalled>anonymous block</soCalled> element <ref target="#TEI.ab">&lt;ab&gt;</ref>. In poetic or dramatic texts different elements are used, representing stanzas and verse lines in the first case, and individual speeches or stage directions in the second: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.p">p</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">paragraph</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">marks paragraphs in prose.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.ab">ab</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">anonymous block</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains any arbitrary component-level unit of text, acting as an anonymous container for phrase or inter level elements analogous to, but without the semantic baggage of, a paragraph.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.l">l</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">verse line</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a single, possibly incomplete, line of verse.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.lg">lg</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">line group</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains one or more verse lines functioning as a formal unit, e.g. a stanza, refrain, verse paragraph, etc.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.sp">sp</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">speech</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains an individual speech in a performance text, or a passage presented as such in a prose or verse text.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.speaker">speaker</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a specialized form of heading or label, giving the name of one or more speakers in a dramatic text or fragment.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.stage">stage</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">stage direction</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains any kind of stage direction within a dramatic text or fragment.</seg></item></list></p><p>We discuss each of these kinds of component separately below.</p><div><head>Verse</head><p>Here, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse lines and stanzas are tagged: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><lg n="I"><l>I Sing the progresse of a deathlesse soule,</l><l>Whom Fate, with God made, but doth not controule,</l><!-- ... --><l>A worke t'out weare Seths pillars, bricke and stone,</l><l>And (holy writs excepted) made to yeeld to none,</l></lg></egXML></p><p>Note that the <ref target="#TEI.l">&lt;l&gt;</ref> element marks verse lines, not typographic lines: as elsewhere the original lineation of the source text is not therefore preserved by this encoding. The <ref target="#TEI.lb">&lt;lb&gt;</ref> element described in section <ptr target="#Simple-pln"/> might additionally be used to mark typographic lines if so desired.</p><p>In a poetic text it may also be considered useful to identify the rhymes, for which the following element may be used: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.rhyme">rhyme</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">marks the rhyming part of a metrical line.</seg><table rend="specDesc"><row><cell rend="Attribute"><hi rend="att">label</hi></cell><cell><seg xml:lang="en">provides a label (usually a single letter) to identify which part of a rhyme scheme this rhyming string instantiates.</seg></cell></row></table></item></list> The following example shows how this element might be used both to identify rhyming words or word parts and to assign each rhyme to a part of a rhyming pattern by means of its <hi rend="att">label</hi> attribute. The rhyming pattern here is specified by the <hi rend="att">rhyme</hi> attribute supplied on the <ref target="#TEI.lg">&lt;lg&gt;</ref> representing the stanza within which the pattern operates: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><lg rhyme="AABCCBBA"><l>The sunlight on the <rhyme label="A">garden</rhyme></l><l><rhyme label="A">Harden</rhyme>s and grows <rhyme label="B">cold</rhyme>,</l><l>We cannot cage the <rhyme label="C">minute</rhyme></l><l>Wi<rhyme label="C">thin it</rhyme>s nets of <rhyme label="B">gold</rhyme></l><l>When all is <rhyme label="B">told</rhyme></l><l>We cannot beg for <rhyme label="A">pardon</rhyme>.</l></lg></egXML> The <hi rend="att">rhyme</hi> attribute may be used independently of the <ref target="#TEI.rhyme">&lt;rhyme&gt;</ref> element, or in combination with it, as above.</p></div><div><head>Drama</head><p>A dramatic text contains speeches, which may be in prose or verse, and will also contain stage directions. The <ref target="#TEI.sp">&lt;sp&gt;</ref> element is used to represent each identified speech. It contains an optional speaker indication, marked with the <ref target="#TEI.speaker">&lt;speaker&gt;</ref> element, which can be followed by one or more <ref target="#TEI.l">&lt;l&gt;</ref> or <ref target="#TEI.p">&lt;p&gt;</ref> elements, depending on whether the speech is considered to be in prose or in verse. Stage directions, whether within or between speeches, are marked using the <ref target="#TEI.stage">&lt;stage&gt;</ref> element.</p><p>For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p>Pull on your trousers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Estragon</speaker><p>You want me to pull off my trousers?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p>Pull <hi>on</hi> your trousers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p><stage>(realizing his trousers are down)</stage>.

Shall we go?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Estragon</speaker><p>Yes, let's go.</p></sp><stage>They do not move.</stage></egXML></p><p>In a verse drama, it is quite common to find that verse lines are split between speakers. The easiest way of encoding this is to use the <hi rend="att">part</hi> attribute to indicate that the lines so fragmented are incomplete: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="Act" n="I"><head>ACT I</head><div type="Scene" n="1"><head>SCENE I</head><stage rendition="#italic">Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two Sentinels, at

                      present I will forbear.</p></sp></div></egXML> Here the <hi rend="att">who</hi> attribute values (<hi rend="val">#OPI</hi> etc.) are links, pointing to items in a list of the characters in the novel. In the case of a play, this list of characters might appear in the original source as a cast list or dramatic personae, which might be marked up using the <ref target="#TEI.castList">&lt;castList&gt;</ref> element described in section <ptr target="#specfronbac"/> below. Such a list would not, of course, be appropriate to provide descriptive information about each character, much of which does not appear in the original source. Instead a <ref target="#TEI.particDesc">&lt;particDesc&gt;</ref> (participant description) element should be provided in the TEI header, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#profDesc"/> below.</p></div><div xml:id="abseg"><head>Other Kinds of Text Block</head><p>As mentioned above, the <ref target="#TEI.ab">&lt;ab&gt;</ref> element may also be used in preference to the <ref target="#TEI.p">&lt;p&gt;</ref> element. It should be used for blocks of text which are not clearly paragraphs, verse lines, or dramatic speeches. Typical examples include the canonical verses of the Bible, and the textual blocks of other ancient documents which predate the invention of the paragraph, such as Greek inscriptions or Egyptian hieroglyphs. The element is also useful as a means of encoding more specialized kinds of textual block, such as the question and answer structure of a catechism, or the highly formalized substructure of a legal document (if <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> is not considered appropriate for these). In more modern documents, it can be used to encode semi-organized or fragmentary materials such as an artist's notebook or work in progress; or to faithfully capture the substructure of a file produced by an OCR system.</p></div></div><div xml:id="Simple-pln"><head>Page and Line Numbers</head><p>Page and line breaks etc. may be marked with the following elements:<list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.pb">pb</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">page break</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">marks the start of a new page in a paginated document.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.lb">lb</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">line break</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">marks the start of a new (typographic) line in some edition or version of a text.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.cb">cb</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">column break</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">marks the beginning of a new column of a text on a multi-column page.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.milestone">milestone</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">marks a boundary point separating any kind of section of a text, typically but not necessarily indicating a point at which some part of a standard reference system changes, where the change is not represented by a structural element.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.fw">fw</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">forme work</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a running head (e.g. a header, footer), catchword, or similar material appearing on the current page.</seg></item></list> The <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb&gt;</ref>, <ref target="#TEI.lb">&lt;lb&gt;</ref>, and <ref target="#TEI.cb">&lt;cb&gt;</ref> elements are special cases of a general class of elements known as <term>milestone</term>s because they mark reference points within a text. The generic <ref target="#TEI.milestone">&lt;milestone&gt;</ref> element can mark any kind of reference point: for example, a column break, the start of a new kind of section not otherwise tagged, a change of author or style, or in general any significant change in the text not enclosed by an XML element. Unlike other elements, milestone elements do not enclose a piece of text and make an assertion about it; instead they indicate a point in the text where something changes, as indicated by a change in the values of the milestone's attributes <hi rend="att">unit</hi>, which indicates the <q>something</q> concerned, and <hi rend="att">n</hi> which indicates the new value.</p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb&gt;</ref>, <ref target="#TEI.lb">&lt;lb&gt;</ref>, and <ref target="#TEI.cb">&lt;cb&gt;</ref> elements are shortcuts or <term>syntactic sugar</term> for <hi rend="tag">&lt;milestone unit="page"/&gt;</hi> <hi rend="tag">&lt;milestone unit="line"/&gt;</hi> and <hi rend="tag">&lt;milestone unit="column"/&gt;</hi> respectively.</p><p>When working from a paginated original, it is often useful to record its pagination, whether to simplify later proof-reading, or to align the transcribed text with a set of page images, as further discussed below.</p><p>Because <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb&gt;</ref> and other milestone elements are empty, they may be placed freely within or between other elements. However, it is recommended practice always to put them at the <emph>beginning</emph> of whatever unit it is that their presence implies, and not to nest them within elements contained by that unit. For example, in the following example a page break occurs between two lines of a poem: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>Mary had a little lamb</l><pb n="13"/><l>Its fleece was white as snow</l></egXML> The <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb&gt;</ref> element should be placed ahead of all the text encoded on the 13th page. Contrast this with the following less accurate encoding: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>Mary had a little lamb</l><l><pb n="13"/>Its fleece was white as snow</l></egXML> This is less accurate because it implies that the second verse line actually begins before the page break.</p><p>Similar considerations apply to line breaks (<ref target="#TEI.lb">&lt;lb&gt;</ref>), though these are less frequently considered useful when encoding modern printed textual sources. When transcribing manuscripts or early printed books, however, it is often helpful to retain them in an encoding, if only to facilitate alignment of transcription and original. Like <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb&gt;</ref>, the <ref target="#TEI.lb">&lt;lb&gt;</ref> element should appear <emph>before</emph> the text of the line whose start it signals.</p><p>If features such as pagination or lineation are marked for more than one edition, the edition in question may be specified by the <hi rend="att">ed</hi> attribute. For example, in the following passage we indicate where the page breaks occur in two different editions (<hi rend="val">ED1</hi> and <hi rend="val">ED2</hi>): <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done:
                fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and <pb ed="ED1" n="475"/> Mary
                approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would <pb ed="ED2" n="485"/>just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see
                me.</p></egXML></p><p>When transcribing from a paginated source, the encoder must decide whether to suppress such features as running titles, page signatures, catch words etc., to replace them by a simplified representation using the <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb&gt;</ref> element, perhaps using the <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute to preserve some of the information, or to preserve them entirely using the <ref target="#TEI.fw">&lt;fw&gt;</ref> element. The latter strategy is appropriate in encodings which aim to retain as much information as possible about the original typography; it will however make more complex the processing of the source for other purposes, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>He also fix'd the wandering
                QUEEN OF NIGHT,</l><fw type="sig">Ii 2</fw><fw type="catch">Whether</fw><pb n="244"/><l>Whether she wanes into a scanty orb</l>...<!-- Thomson, Seasons, 1730--></egXML></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb&gt;</ref> element is also used to align parts of a transcription with a digital image of the page concerned. This may be done in a very simple but inflexible way by using the <hi rend="att">facs</hi> attribute to point to each page image concerned: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge
                immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.
                Diana and <pb ed="ED1" n="475" facs="ed1p475.png"/> Mary approved the step

This may also be used to indicate the kind of quotation marks used.</p><p>Direct speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply by ending the <ref target="#TEI.q">&lt;q&gt;</ref> element and beginning it again after the interruption, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>Who-e debel

Where there is no applicable element, the element <ref target="#TEI.foreign">&lt;foreign&gt;</ref> may be used, again using the <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi> attribute.

The second <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> element however overrides this value, and indicates that its content is in English (the language with identifier <hi rend="val">en</hi>).

A note is always attached to some part of the text, implicitly or explicitly: we call this its target, or its <term>point of attachment</term>. The element <ref target="#TEI.note">&lt;note&gt;</ref> should be used to mark any kind of note whether it appears as a separate block of text in the main text area, at the foot of the page, at the end of the chapter or volume, in the margin, or in some other place. <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.note">note</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a note or annotation.</seg></item></list></p><p>Notes may be in a different hand or typeface, may be authorial or editorial, and may have been added later. The attributes <hi rend="att">type</hi> and <hi rend="att">resp</hi> can be used to distinguish between different kinds of notes or identify their authors.</p><p>In a printed or written text, the point of attachment for a note is typically represented by a siglum such as an alphanumerical or other character, often in superscripted form. When encoding such a text, it is conventional to replace this siglum by a note element containing the annotation itself, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>...some text <note xml:id="n7">a note about some text</note> .... </p></egXML></p><p>An alternative approach is to encode the point of attachment wherever it appears in the text, using for example the <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> element discussed in the next section, and to place the <ref target="#TEI.note">&lt;note&gt;</ref> element anywhere convenient. The two can then be associated by using the <hi rend="att">target</hi> attribute on the <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> element to point to the <ref target="#TEI.note">&lt;note&gt;</ref> element, as in the following example, in which the superscripted <q>7</q> indicating the point of attachment has been retained as part of the encoding: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>...some text <ref target="#n7" rendition="simple:superscript">7</ref> .... <note xml:id="n7">a note about some text</note></p></egXML></p><p>It may however be problematic to determine the precise position of the point of attachment, particularly in the case of marginal notes. A marginal note may also be hard to distinguish from a label or subheading which introduces the text with which it is associated. Where the purpose of the note is clearly to label the associated text, rather than to comment on it, the element <ref target="#TEI.label">&lt;label&gt;</ref> may be preferable. Where it is clearly a subheading attached to a distinct subdivision, it may be preferable to start a new element <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> and encode the subheading as a <ref target="#TEI.head">&lt;head&gt;</ref>. Note however that a <ref target="#TEI.head">&lt;head&gt;</ref> cannot be inserted anywhere except at the beginning of a <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref>. And where (as in some Early Modern English plays) marginal annotation is systematically used to identify speakers, it may be better to represent these using the <ref target="#TEI.speaker">&lt;speaker&gt;</ref> element introduced above. In cases of doubt, the encoder should decide on a clear policy and preferably document it for the use of others.</p></div><div xml:id="Simple-ptrs"><head>Cross References and Links</head><p>Any kind of cross reference or link found at one point in a text which points to another part of the same or another document may be encoded using the <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> element discussed in this section. Implicit links (such as the association between two parallel texts, or that between a text and its interpretation) may be encoded using the linking attributes discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><div xml:id="ptrs"><head>Simple Cross References</head><p><list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.ref">ref</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">reference</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">defines a reference to another location, possibly modified by additional text or comment.</seg></item></list></p><p>Usually, the presence of a cross-reference or link will be indicated by some text or symbol in the source being encoded, which will then become the content of the <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> element. Occasionally, however, and frequently in the case of a born digital document, the exact form and appearance of the cross reference text will be determined dynamically by the software processing the document. In such cases, the <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> element will have no content, and serve simply to mark a point from which a link is to be made, along with the target of the link.</p><p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12">section
                  12 on page 34</ref>.</egXML> <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML> In both cases, there is a cross reference from the position in the source document immediately following the word <mentioned>especially</mentioned> to whatever element in the encoded document has the identifier <hi rend="val">SEC12</hi>. In the first case, the encoder has supplied the original form of the cross reference <soCalled>section 12 on page 34</soCalled>; in the second, the task of generating an appropriate form of cross reference has been left to the formatting software. Perhaps the pagination and section numbers of the document in question are not yet determined; perhaps the cross reference should be replaced by a big red button. In either case, however, the value of the <hi rend="att">target</hi> attribute must be the identifier of some other element within the current document. Since the passage or phrase being pointed at must bear an identifier, it must be an element of some kind. In the following example, the cross reference is to a <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... see especially <ref target="#SEC12"/>.
                ... <div xml:id="SEC12"><head>Concerning Identifiers</head><!-- ... --></div></egXML></p><p>Because the <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute is global, any element in a TEI document may be pointed to in this way. In the following example, a paragraph has been given an identifier so that it may be pointed at: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... this is discussed in <ref target="#pspec">the paragraph on links</ref> ... <p xml:id="pspec">Links may be
                  made to any kind of element ...</p></egXML></p><p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference does not correspond with any particular feature of a text, and so may not be tagged as an element of some kind. If the desired target is simply a point in the current document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an <ref target="#TEI.anchor">&lt;anchor&gt;</ref> element at the appropriate spot. If the target is some sequence of words not otherwise tagged, the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element may be used to mark them. These two elements are described as follows: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.anchor">anchor</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">anchor point</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">attaches an identifier to a point within a text, whether or not it corresponds with a textual element.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.seg">seg</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">arbitrary segment</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">represents any segmentation of text below the <soCalled xmlns:rng="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0" xmlns:teix="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">chunk</soCalled> level.</seg></item></list></p><p>In the following example, <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> elements have been used to represent points in this text which are to be linked in some way to other parts of it; in the first case to a point, and in the second, to a sequence of words: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Returning to <ref target="#ABCD">the point
                  where I dozed off</ref>, I noticed that <ref target="#EFGH">three words</ref> had
                been circled in red by a previous reader</egXML></p><p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified identifiers (<hi rend="val">ABCD</hi> and <hi rend="val">EFGH</hi> in this example) are to be found somewhere else in the current document. Assuming that no element already exists to carry these identifiers, the <ref target="#TEI.anchor">&lt;anchor&gt;</ref> and <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> elements may be used: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> .... <anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> .... ....<seg type="target" xml:id="EFGH"> ... </seg> ...</egXML></p><p>The <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute should be used (as above) to distinguish amongst different purposes for which these general purpose elements might be used in a text. Some other uses are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> below.</p></div><div xml:id="xptrs"><head>Pointing to other documents</head><p>So far, we have shown how the <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> element may be used for cross-references or links whose targets occur within the same document as their source. The element may also be used to refer to elements in any other XML document or resource, such as a document on the web, or a database component. This is possible because the value of the <hi rend="att">target</hi> attribute may be any valid <term>Uniform Resource Identifier</term> (URI)<note place="foot">A full definition of this term, defined by the W3C (the consortium which manages the development and maintenance of the World Wide Web), is beyond the scope of this tutorial: however, the most frequently encountered version of a URI is the familiar URL used to indicate a web page, such as <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code></note>.</p><p>A URI may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2</code>. The hash sign indicates that what follows it is the identifier of an element to be located within the XML document identified by what precedes it: this example will therefore locate an element which has an <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute value of <hi rend="val">SEC2</hi> within the document retrieved from <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>. In the examples we have discussed so far, the part to the left of the sharp sign has been omitted: this is understood to mean that the referenced element is to be located within the current document.</p><p>It is also possible to define an abbreviated form of the URI, using a predefined <term>prefix</term> separated from the rest of the code by a colon, as for example <hi rend="val">cesr:SEC2</hi>. This is known as a <term>private URI</term>, since the prefix is not standardized (except that the prefix <hi rend="val">xml:</hi> is reserved for use by XML itself). A <ref target="#TEI.prefixDef">&lt;prefixDef&gt;</ref> element should be supplied within the TEI header specifying how the prefix (here <hi rend="val">cesr</hi>) should be translated to give a full URL for the link. This is particularly useful if a document contains many references to an external document such as an authority file.</p><p>Parts of an XML document can be specified by means of other more sophisticated mechanisms using a language called Xpointer, also defined by the W3C. This is useful when, for example, the elements to be linked to do not bear identifiers. Further information about this and other forms of link addressing is provided in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html">chapter 16 of the TEI Guidelines</ref> but is beyond the scope of the present document.</p></div><div xml:id="xatts"><head>Special Kinds of Linking</head><p>The following special purpose <term>linking</term> attributes are defined for every element in the TEI simplePrint schema: <list type="gloss"><label><hi rend="att">ana</hi></label><item>links an element with its interpretation.</item><label><hi rend="att">corresp</hi></label><item>links an element with one or more other corresponding elements.</item><label><hi rend="att">next</hi></label><item>links an element to the next element in an aggregate.</item><label><hi rend="att">prev</hi></label><item>links an element to the previous element in an aggregate.</item></list></p><p>The <hi rend="att">ana</hi> (analysis) attribute is intended for use where a set of abstract analyses or interpretations have been defined somewhere within a document, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#Simple-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis of the sentence <q>John loves Nancy</q> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg type="sentence" ana="#SVO"><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">John</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#VVI">loves</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">Nancy</seg></seg></egXML> This encoding implies the existence elsewhere in the document of elements with identifiers <hi rend="val">SVO</hi>, <hi rend="val">NP1</hi>, and <hi rend="val">VV1</hi> where the significance of these particular codes is explained. Note the use of the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element to mark particular components of the analysis, distinguished by the <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">corresp</hi> (corresponding) attribute provides a simple way of representing some form of correspondence between two elements in a text. For example, in a multilingual text, it may be used to link translation equivalents, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg xml:lang="fr" xml:id="FR1" corresp="#EN1">Jean aime Nancy</seg><seg xml:lang="en" xml:id="EN1" corresp="#FR1">John loves Nancy</seg></egXML></p><p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes.

                  debel you?</q> — he at last said — <q xml:id="Q1b" prev="#Q1a">you no speak-e,

In addition, some material may be particularly hard to transcribe because it is hard to make out on the page. The following elements may be used to record such phenomena: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.add">add</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">addition</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains letters, words, or phrases inserted in the source text by an author, scribe, or a previous annotator or corrector.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.gap">gap</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">indicates a point where material has been omitted in a transcription, whether for editorial reasons described in the TEI header, as part of sampling practice, or because the material is illegible, invisible, or inaudible.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.del">del</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">deletion</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a letter, word, or passage deleted, marked as deleted, or otherwise indicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an author, scribe, or a previous annotator or corrector.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.unclear">unclear</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a word, phrase, or passage which cannot be transcribed with certainty because it is illegible or inaudible in the source.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.supplied">supplied</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">signifies text supplied by the transcriber or editor for any reason; for example because the original cannot be read due to physical damage, or because of an obvious omission by the author or scribe.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.subst">subst</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">substitution</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">groups one or more deletions with one or more additions when the combination is to be regarded as a single intervention in the text.</seg></item></list></p><p>These elements may be used to record changes made by an editor, by the transcriber, or (in manuscript material) by the author or scribe. For example, if the source for an electronic text read <q>The following elements are provided for for simple editorial interventions.</q> then it might be felt desirable to correct the obvious error, but at the same time to record the deletion of the superfluous second <mentioned>for</mentioned>, thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The
              following elements are provided for <del resp="#LB">for</del> simple editorial
              interventions.</egXML> The attribute value <hi rend="val">#LB</hi> on the <hi rend="att">resp</hi> attribute is used to point to a fuller definition (typically in a <ref target="#TEI.respStmt">&lt;respStmt&gt;</ref> element) of the person or other agency responsible for correcting the duplication of <mentioned>for</mentioned>.</p><p>If the source read <q>The following elements provided for simple editorial interventions.</q> (i.e. if the word <mentioned>are</mentioned> had been inadvertently dropped) then the scholar identified as <hi rend="val">LB</hi> might choose to encode the corrected text as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following
              elements <add resp="#LB">are</add> provided for simple editorial
              interventions.</egXML></p><p>These elements may also be used to record the actual writing process, for example to record passages which have been deleted, added, corrected etc., whether by the author of a literary text or by a scribe copying out a manuscript. An analysis of such documentary modifications may be essential before a reading text can be presented, and is clearly of importance in the editorial process. </p><p>The example is taken from the surviving authorial manuscript of a poem by the English writer Wilfred Owen, a part of which is shown here: </p><figure><graphic url="./../Images/PHowen.png" width="400px" height="100px"/><head type="legend">Detail from <title>Dulce et decorum est</title> autograph manuscript in the English Faculty Library, Oxford University.</head></figure><p>Owen first wrote <q>Helping the worst amongst us</q>, but then deleted it, adding <q>Dragging the worst amongt us</q> over the top. In the same way, he revised the phrase <q>half–blind</q> by deleting the <q>half–</q> and adding <q>all</q> above it. In the last line, he started a word beginning <q>fif</q> before deleting it and writing the word <q>five–nines</q>. We can encode all of this as follows:</p><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>And towards our distant rest began to trudge,</l><l><subst><del>Helping the worst amongst us</del><add>Dragging the worst amongt us</add></subst>, who’d no boots </l><l>But limped on, blood–shod.

Additional attributes are available such as <hi rend="att">resp</hi> to indicate responsibility for the modification, or <hi rend="att">place</hi> to indicate where in the text (for example, above or below the line) the modification has been made. Where the encoder wishes to assert that the addition and deletion make up a single editorial act of substitution, these elements can be combined within a <ref target="#TEI.subst">&lt;subst&gt;</ref> element as shown above.</p><p>A very careful examination of Owen’s second modification shows that he really did write <q>amongt</q> rather than <q>amongst</q>, presumably in error. An equally careful editor wishing to restore the missing <q>s</q> might use the <ref target="#TEI.supplied">&lt;supplied&gt;</ref> element to indicate that they have done so:</p><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><add>Dragging the worst among<supplied resp="#ED">s</supplied>t us</add></egXML><p>Here the <hi rend="att">resp</hi> attribute has been used to indicate that the <q>s</q> was not supplied by Owen but by someone else, specifically the person documented elsewhere by an element with the identifier <hi rend="val">ED</hi>.</p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.unclear">&lt;unclear&gt;</ref> element is useful where material in the source is so hard to read that the transcriber is uncertain as to whether they have done so correctly. The <ref target="#TEI.gap">&lt;gap&gt;</ref> element by contrast should be used where the material is so illegible that the transcriber does not wish even to attempt it. The two may however be used together as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">One hundred &amp; twenty good regulars joined <unclear>to me <gap extent="2 words" reason="indecipherable"/> and </unclear> instantly, would aid me signally in an
              enterprise against Wilmington.</egXML></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.del">&lt;del&gt;</ref> element marks material which is deleted in a source, but has been transcribed as part of the electronic text all the same, while <ref target="#TEI.gap">&lt;gap&gt;</ref> marks the location of source material which is omitted from the electronic text, whether it is legible or not. A language corpus, for example, might omit long quotations in foreign languages. An <hi rend="att">extent</hi> attribute is available on the <ref target="#TEI.gap">&lt;gap&gt;</ref> element to indicate how much material has been omitted. The <ref target="#TEI.desc">&lt;desc&gt;</ref> element can be used inside the <ref target="#TEI.gap">&lt;gap&gt;</ref> element to provide a brief characterisation of the omitted material, as in the following examples: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p> ... An example of a list appearing in a fief ledger of <name type="place">Koldinghus</name><date>1611/12</date> is given below. It shows cash income from a sale of

              manufacturer of <abbr>3GL</abbr> or <abbr>4GL</abbr> languages is currently nailing on
                <abbr>OOP</abbr> extensions</egXML></p><p>The <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute may be used to distinguish types of abbreviation by their function.</p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.expan">&lt;expan&gt;</ref> element is used to mark an expansion supplied by an encoder. This element is particularly useful in the transcription of manuscript materials. For example, the character p with a bar through its descender as a conventional representation for the word <hi rend="val">per</hi> is commonly encountered in Medieval European manuscripts. An encoder may choose to expand this as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>per</expan></egXML></p><p>To record both an abbreviation and its expansion, the <ref target="#TEI.choice">&lt;choice&gt;</ref> element mentioned above may be used to group the abbreviated form with its proposed expansion: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><choice><abbr>wt</abbr><expan>with</expan></choice></egXML></p><p>The elements <ref target="#TEI.expan">&lt;expan&gt;</ref> and <ref target="#TEI.abbr">&lt;abbr&gt;</ref> should contain a full word, or the abbreviated form of a full word respectively. <!--If it is required to tag smaller
            components of an abbreviated word, the following elements are also available in TEI
            Simple: <specList>
              <specDesc key="am"/>
              <specDesc key="ex"/>
            </specList>--> For a fuller discussion of abbreviations and the intricacies of representing them consult the section on <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHAB">Abbreviation and Expansion</ref> in the TEI Guidelines.</p></div></div><div xml:id="Simple-names"><head>Names, Codes, and Numbers</head><p>The TEI scheme defines elements for a large number of <soCalled>data-like</soCalled> features which may appear almost anywhere within almost any kind of text. These features may be of particular interest in a range of disciplines; they all relate to objects external to the text itself, such as the names of persons and places, strings of code, formulae, or numbers and dates. These items may also pose particular problems for natural language processing (NLP) applications. The elements described here, by making such features explicit, reduce the complexity of processing texts containing them.</p><div xml:id="nomen"><head>Names and Referring Strings</head><p>A <term>referring string</term> is any phrase which refers to some person, place, object, etc. A <term>name</term> is a referring string which contains proper nouns and honorifics only.

              said, <q>Possibly.</q></egXML></p><p>As the following example shows, the <ref target="#TEI.rs">&lt;rs&gt;</ref> element may be used for a reference to a person, place, etc., which does not contain a proper noun or noun phrase: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <name type="person">Mr.
                  Bennet</name>,</q> said <rs type="person">his lady</rs> to him one day...</egXML></p><p>Simply tagging something as a name is rarely enough to enable automatic processing of personal names into the canonical forms usually required for reference purposes. The name as it appears in the text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague. Moreover, name prefixes such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de la</mentioned>, may or may not be included as part of the reference form of a name, depending on the language and country of origin of the bearer.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">ref</hi> attribute provides a way of linking a name with a description of the object being named, and may thus act as a normalized identifier for it. It is also very useful as a means of gathering together all references to the same individual or location scattered throughout a document: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <name type="person" ref="#BENM1">Mr. Bennet</name>, </q> said <rs type="person" ref="#BENM2">his lady</rs> to him

                  Park</name> is let at last?</q></egXML></p><p>The values used for the <hi rend="att">ref</hi> attribute here (<hi rend="val">#BENM1</hi> etc.) are pointers; in this case indicating an element with the identifier <hi rend="val">BENM1</hi> etc. somewhere in the current document, though any form of URI could be used. The element indicated will typically (for a person) be a <ref target="#TEI.person">&lt;person&gt;</ref> element, listed within a <ref target="#TEI.particDesc">&lt;particDesc&gt;</ref> element, or (for a place) a <ref target="#TEI.place">&lt;place&gt;</ref> element, listed within a <ref target="#TEI.settingDesc">&lt;settingDesc&gt;</ref> element in the TEI header, as further discussed in <ptr target="#profDesc"/> below.</p><p>This use should be distinguished from the case of the <ref target="#TEI.reg">&lt;reg&gt;</ref> (regularization) element, which provides a means of marking the standard form of a referencing string as demonstrated below: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><name type="person" ref="#WADLM1"><choice><orig>Walter de la Mare</orig><reg>de la Mare, Walter</reg></choice></name> was born at <name key="Ch1" type="place">Charlton</name>, in <name key="KT1" type="county">Kent</name>, in 1873.</egXML></p></div><div xml:id="code"><head>Formulae, Codes, and Special Characters</head><p>The following elements may be useful when marking up sequences of text that represent mathematical expressions, chemical formulae, and the like: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.formula">formula</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a mathematical or other formula.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.g">g</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">character or glyph</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">represents a glyph, or a non-standard character.</seg></item></list></p><p>In many cases, a simple Unicode character suffices to represent the superscript or subscript digits and other symbols which may appear inside a mathematical formula: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><formula>E=mc²</formula></egXML> In other more complex cases, the encoder may choose to use a different XML scheme (such as MathML) to encode the content of a formula, or a non-XML notation.

The most straightforward text will often contain diagrams or illustrations, to say nothing of documents in which image and text are inextricably intertwined, or electronic resources in which the two are complementary. </p><p>The encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the text, possibly with a brief description of its content, and may also provide a link to a digitized version of the graphic, using the following elements: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.graphic">graphic</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">indicates the location of a graphic or illustration, either forming part of a text, or providing an image of it.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.figure">figure</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">groups elements representing or containing graphic information such as an illustration, formula, or figure.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.figDesc">figDesc</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">description of figure</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a brief prose description of the appearance or content of a graphic figure, for use when documenting an image without displaying it.</seg></item></list></p><p>Any textual information accompanying the graphic, such as a heading and/or caption, may be included within the <ref target="#TEI.figure">&lt;figure&gt;</ref> element itself, in a <ref target="#TEI.head">&lt;head&gt;</ref> and one or more <ref target="#TEI.p">&lt;p&gt;</ref> elements, as may any text appearing within the graphic itself. It is strongly recommended that a prose description of the image be supplied, as the content of a <ref target="#TEI.figDesc">&lt;figDesc&gt;</ref> element, for the use of applications which are not able to render the graphic, and to render the document accessible to vision-impaired readers. (Such text is not normally considered part of the document proper.)</p><p>The simplest use for these elements is to mark the position of a graphic and provide a link to it, as in this example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="412"/><figure><graphic url="./../Images/p412fig.png" width="40%"/></figure><pb n="413"/></egXML> This indicates that the graphic contained by the file <ident>p412fig.png</ident> appears between pages 412 and 413.</p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.graphic">&lt;graphic&gt;</ref> element can appear anywhere that textual content is permitted, within but not between paragraphs or headings. In the following example, the encoder has decided to treat a specific printer's ornament as a heading: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head><graphic url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/></head></egXML></p><p>More usually, a graphic will have at the least an identifying title, which may be encoded using the <ref target="#TEI.head">&lt;head&gt;</ref> element, or a number of figures may be grouped together in a particular structure, as in the following example: <figure><graphic url="./../Images/fezziPic.png" width="495px" height="640px"/><head><title>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</title>: illustration by George Cruikshank from Dickens' <title>A Christmas Carol</title> (1843)</head></figure> The <ref target="#TEI.figure">&lt;figure&gt;</ref> element provides a means of wrapping one or more such elements together as a kind of graphic <soCalled>block</soCalled>. It may also include a brief description of the image: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><figure><graphic url="./../Images/fezzipic.png"/><head>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</head><figDesc>A Cruikshank engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading a group of
                revellers.</figDesc></figure></egXML></p><p>These cases should be carefully distinguished from the case where an encoded text is complemented by a collection of digital images, maintained as a distinct resource. The <hi rend="att">facs</hi> attribute may be used to associate any element in an encoded text with a digital facsimile of it. In the simplest case, the <hi rend="att">facs</hi> attribute on the <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb&gt;</ref> element may be used to supply a location for an image file corresponding with that point in the text: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div><pb facs="page1.png" n="1"/><!-- text contained on page 1 is encoded here --><pb facs="page2.png" n="2"/><!-- text contained on page 2 is encoded here --></div></egXML> This method is only appropriate in the simple case where each digital image file <ident>page1.png</ident> etc. corresponds with a single transcribed and encoded page. If multiple images are provided for each page, or more detailed alignment of image and transcription is required, for example because the image files actually represent double page spreads, more sophisticated mechanisms are needed, as further discussed in <ptr target="#Simple-fax"/> below.</p></div><div xml:id="Simple-anal"><head>Analysis</head><div><head>Orthographic Sentences</head><p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with no particular respect to other structural units. A useful preliminary to intensive interpretation is therefore to segment the text into discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label for use as a sort of <soCalled>canonical reference</soCalled>. To facilitate such uses, these units may not cross each other, nor nest within each other. They may conveniently be represented using the following element: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.s">s</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">s-unit</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a sentence-like division of a text.</seg></item></list></p><p>As the name suggests, the <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> element is most commonly used (in linguistic applications at least) for marking <term>orthographic sentences</term>, that is, units defined by orthographic features such as punctuation. For example, the passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title> discussed earlier might be divided into s-units as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><pb n="474"/><p><s n="001">Reader, I married him.</s><s n="002">A quiet wedding we had:</s><s n="003">he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.</s><s n="004">When
                    we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary
                    was cooking the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said —</s></p><p><q><s n="005">Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.</s></q> ...
                </p></div></egXML> Note that <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> elements cannot nest: the beginning of one <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> element implies that the previous one has finished. When s-units are tagged as shown above, it is advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that every word in the text being analyzed will be contained by exactly one <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> element, whose identifier can then be used to specify a unique reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within the document, then the <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute might be used in preference to the <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute used in the above example.</p></div><div><head>Words and Punctuation</head><p>Tokenization, that is, the identification of lexical or non-lexical tokens within a text, is a very common requirement for all kinds of textual analysis, and not an entirely trivial one. The decision as to whether, for example, <q>can't</q> in English or <q>du</q> in French should be treated as one word or two is not simple. Consequently it is often useful to make explicit the preferred tokenization in a marked up text. The following elements are available for this purpose: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.w">w</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">word</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">represents a grammatical (not necessarily orthographic) word.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.c">c</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">character</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">represents a character.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.pc">pc</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">punctuation character</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a character or string of characters regarded as constituting a single punctuation mark.</seg></item></list></p><p>For example, the output from a part of speech tagger might be recorded in TEI simplePrint as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><s n="1"><w ana="#NP0">Marley</w><w ana="#VBD">was</w><w ana="#AJ0">dead</w><pc>:</pc><w ana="#TO0">to</w><w ana="#VBB">begin</w><w ana="#PRP">with</w><pc ana="#SENT">.</pc></s></egXML></p><p>In this example, each token in the input has been decorated with an automatically generated part of speech code, using the <hi rend="att">ana</hi> attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above. The system has also distinguished between tokens to be treated as words (tagged <ref target="#TEI.w">&lt;w&gt;</ref>) and tokens considered to be punctuation (tagged <ref target="#TEI.pc">&lt;pc&gt;</ref>). It may also sometimes be useful to distinguish tokens which consist of a single letter or character: the <ref target="#TEI.c">&lt;c&gt;</ref> element is provided for this purpose. <!-- some crazy people mark up interword space with a c: shd that be mentioned? --></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.w">&lt;w&gt;</ref> also provides for each word to be associated with a root form or lemma, either explicitly using the <hi rend="att">lemma</hi> attribute, or by reference, using the <hi rend="att">lemmaRef</hi> attribute, as in this example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">...<w ana="#VBD" lemma="be" lemmaRef="http://www.myLexicon.com/be">was</w> ... </egXML></p></div><div><head>General-Purpose Interpretation Elements</head><p>The <ref target="#TEI.w">&lt;w&gt;</ref> element is a specialisation of the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element which has already been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked targets of cross references and hypertext links (see section <ptr target="#Simple-ptrs"/>); it can be used to distinguish any portion of text to which the encoder wishes to assign a user-specified <hi rend="att">type</hi> or a unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag textual features for which there is no other provision in the published TEI Guidelines.</p><p>For example, the TEI Guidelines provide no <soCalled>apostrophe</soCalled> element to mark parts of a literary text in which the narrator addresses the reader (or hearer) directly. One approach might be to regard these as instances of the <ref target="#TEI.q">&lt;q&gt;</ref> element, distinguished from others by an appropriate value for the <hi rend="att">who</hi> attribute. A possibly simpler, and certainly more general, solution would however be to use the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><seg type="apostrophe">Reader, I married him.</seg> A quiet wedding we had:
                  ...</p></div></egXML> The <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute on the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element can take any value, and so can be used to distinguish phrase-level phenomena of any kind; it is good practice to record the values used and their significance in the TEI header or in the documentation of the encoding system. <!-- mention ODD! --></p></div></div><div><head>Common Attributes</head><p>Some attributes are available on many elements, though not on all.

To indicate, for example, that a particular name in the document was rendered in a bold font it might be tagged <hi rend="tag">&lt;name rendition="#rend-bo"&gt;</hi>. The <hi rend="att">selector</hi> attribute used in the preceding example is used to indicate once for all a default rendition value to be associated with several elements: in this example, unless otherwise indicated, it is assumed that the content of each <ref target="#TEI.hi">&lt;hi&gt;</ref> and each <ref target="#TEI.title">&lt;title&gt;</ref> element was originally rendered using an italic font.</p><p>For TEI simplePrint, a large set of such rendition definitions has been predefined.

This may be done with reference to a classification system locally defined by means of the <ref target="#TEI.classDecl">&lt;classDecl&gt;</ref> element, or by reference to some externally defined established scheme such as the Universal Decimal Classification. Texts may also be classified using lists of keywords, which may themselves be drawn from locally or externally defined control lists. The following elements are used to supply such classifications: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.classCode">classCode</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">classification code</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains the classification code used for this text in some standard classification system.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.catRef">catRef</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">category reference</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">specifies one or more defined categories within some taxonomy or text typology.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.keywords">keywords</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a list of keywords or phrases identifying the topic or nature of a text.</seg></item></list></p><p>The simplest way of classifying a text is by means of the <ref target="#TEI.classCode">&lt;classCode&gt;</ref> element. For example, a text with classification 410 in the Universal Decimal Classification might be documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classCode scheme="http://www.udc.org">410</classCode></egXML></p><p>When a classification scheme has been locally defined using the <ref target="#TEI.taxonomy">&lt;taxonomy&gt;</ref> element discussed in the preceding subsection, the <ref target="#TEI.catRef">&lt;catRef&gt;</ref> element should be used to reference it. To continue the earlier example, a work classified in the Brown Corpus as <hi rend="val">Press reportage - Sunday</hi> and also as <hi rend="val">Religion</hi> might be documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catRef target="#B.A3 #B.D"/></egXML></p><p>The element <ref target="#TEI.keywords">&lt;keywords&gt;</ref> contains one or more keywords or phrases identifying the topic or nature of a text, each tagged as a <ref target="#TEI.term">&lt;term&gt;</ref>. As usual, the attribute <hi rend="att">scheme</hi> identifies the source from which these terms are taken. For example, if the LC Subject Headings are used, following declaration of that classification system in a <ref target="#TEI.taxonomy">&lt;taxonomy&gt;</ref> element as above: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><textClass><keywords scheme="#LCSH"><term>English literature</term><term>History and criticism</term><term>Data processing.</term></keywords></textClass></egXML></p><p>Multiple classifications may be supplied using any of the mechanisms described in this section.</p></div><div><head>Other forms of metadata</head><p>The TEI header was one of the first attempts to provide a full range of metadata elements, but it is by no means the only standard now used for this purpose. To facilitate the management of large digital collections and to simplify interoperability of TEI and non-TEI resources, the following element may be found useful: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.xenoData">xenoData</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">non-TEI metadata</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">provides a container element into which metadata in non-TEI formats may be placed.</seg></item></list></p><p>A typical use for this element might be to store a set of descriptors conforming to the Dublin Core standard in the TEI header rather than to generate them automatically from the corresponding TEI elements.

As noted above, the TEI provides components such as the <hi rend="att">rendition</hi> attribute to indicate the appearance of particular parts of a document in the non-digital source from which it is derived. With TEI simplePrint, it is also possible to indicate how in general an element should be processed, in particular its intended appearance when processed for display on a screen or on paper. This ability derives from a number of capabilities recently added to the TEI architecture for the specification of processing, which were developed as part of the project that defined the TEI simplePrint schema.</p><p>The key feature of this <soCalled>Processing Model</soCalled> is a notation that allows the encoder to associate each element with one or more categories, which we call its <term>behaviour</term>s. In addition, the Processing Model indicates how the element should be rendered, possibly differently in differing circumstances, using the W3C Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) mentioned above. It is consequently much easier to develop processors for documents conforming to TEI simplePrint, since the complexity of the task is much reduced.</p><p>Twenty-five different behaviours are currently defined by the TEI Processing Model. Their names indicate informally the categorization concerned, and should be readily comprehensible for most programmers. The following table indicates the TEI simplePrint elements associated with each:</p><table><row role="label"><cell>Behaviour</cell><cell>Used by</cell><cell>Effect</cell></row><row><cell>alternate</cell><cell>choice date</cell><cell>support display of alternative visualizations, for example by displaying the preferred content, by displaying both in parallel, or by toggling between the two.</cell><!-- document(model.xml)/elementSpec/attList/attDef[@ident='behaviour']/valList/valItem[@ident='{../cell[1]}']/desc --></row><row><cell>anchor</cell><cell>anchor </cell><cell>create an identifiable anchor point in the output. </cell></row><row><cell>block</cell><cell>address addrLine argument back body byline closer dateline div docTitle epigraph figure floatingText formula front fw group head imprimatur l lg listBibl note opener postscript q quote role roleDesc salute signed sp speaker spGrp stage titlePage titlePart trailer </cell><cell>create a block structure</cell></row><row><cell>body</cell><cell>text </cell><cell>create the body of a document</cell></row><row><cell>break</cell><cell>cb lb pb</cell><cell>create a line, column, or page break according to the value of <ident>type</ident></cell></row><row><cell>cell</cell><cell>cell </cell><cell>create a table cell</cell></row><row><cell>cit</cell><cell>cit </cell><cell>show the content, with an indication of the source</cell></row><row><cell>document</cell><cell>TEI </cell><cell>start a new output document</cell></row><row><cell>glyph</cell><cell>g </cell><cell>show a character by looking up reference to a chardesc at the given URI</cell></row><row><cell>graphic</cell><cell>graphic </cell><cell>if <ident>URL</ident> is present, use it to display graphic, else display a placeholder image</cell></row><row><cell>heading</cell><cell>head </cell><cell>creates a heading</cell></row><row><cell>index</cell><cell>body </cell><cell>generate list according to type</cell></row><row><cell>inline</cell><cell>abbr actor add am author bibl biblScope c choice code corr date del desc docAuthor docDate docEdition docImprint editor email ex expan figDesc figure foreign formula fw g gap hi label measure milestone name note num orig pc q quote ref reg relatedItem rhyme rs s salute seg sic signed subst supplied time title unclear w </cell><cell>creates inline element out of content if there's something in <gi>outputRendition</gi>, use that formatting; otherwise just show text of selected content</cell></row><row><cell>link</cell><cell>ref </cell><cell>create hyperlink</cell></row><row><cell>list</cell><cell>castGroup castList list listBibl </cell><cell>create a list</cell></row><row><cell>listItem</cell><cell>bibl castItem item </cell><cell>create a list item</cell></row><row><cell>metadata</cell><cell>teiHeader </cell><cell>create metadata section</cell></row><row><cell>note</cell><cell>note </cell><cell>create a note, often out of line, depending on the value of place; could be margin, footnote, endnote, inline</cell></row><row><cell>omit</cell><cell>author editor publisher pubPlace profileDesc revisionDesc encodingDesc </cell><cell>do nothing, do not process children </cell></row><row><cell>paragraph</cell><cell>ab p</cell><cell>create a paragraph out of content</cell></row><row><cell>row</cell><cell>row </cell><cell>create a table row</cell></row><row><cell>section</cell><cell>div </cell><cell>create a new section of the output document</cell></row><row><cell>table</cell><cell>table </cell><cell>create a table</cell></row><row><cell>text</cell><cell>title</cell><cell>create literal text</cell></row><row><cell>title</cell><cell>fileDesc </cell><cell>create document title</cell></row></table><p>Full documentation of the Processing Model is provided in section <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html#TDPM"/> of the TEI Guidelines, and we do not describe it further here.</p></div><div><head>The TEI simplePrint schema</head><p>Like other TEI customizations, TEI simplePrint is defined by reference to the TEI Guidelines.

            skills which have a wider relevance to the educational process. From
            a set of more or less instinctive rules of thumb a formal discipline
            or "methodology" of database design has evolved. Applying that
            methodology can be of great benefit to a very wide range of academic
            subjects: it requires fundamental skills of abstraction and
            generalisation and it provides a simple mechanism whereby complex
            ideas and information structures can be represented and manipulated,
            even without the use of a computer. </p></abstract></profileDesc></egXML></cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Content model</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2"><eg xml:space="preserve">

                        publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the
                        image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database
                        (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy
                        (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published
                        between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p><p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project
                        restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic
                        transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural
                        encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p><p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
                        Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January
                        2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we
                        respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original
                        source.</p><p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any
                        assumptions that can be made about the data.</p><p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature
                        (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then
                        their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide
                        variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the
                        period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although
                        there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and
                        sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling
                        reason to do so.</p><p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic
                        encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and
                        Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for
                        accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be
                        redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters
                        marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per
                        text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these
                        processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good,
                        some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible.
                        Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been
                        looked at by a TCP editor.</p><p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the
                        TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p><p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with
                        mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters
                        represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML
                        (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p><p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership
                        web site</ref>.</p></editorialDecl></encodingDesc></egXML></cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Content model</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2"><eg xml:space="preserve">

            of altered food choices and nonuniform consumption patterns.</p></div><div><head> OBJECTIVE:</head><p>We examined the association between obesity and both child-level
            food insecurity and personal food insecurity in US children.</p></div><div><head> DESIGN:</head><p>Data from 9,701 participants in the National Health and Nutrition
            Examination Survey, 2001-2010, aged 2 to 11 years were analyzed.
            Child-level food insecurity was assessed with the US Department of
            Agriculture's Food Security Survey Module based on eight
            child-specific questions. Personal food insecurity was assessed with
            five additional questions. Obesity was defined, using physical
            measurements, as body mass index (calculated as kg/m2) greater than
            or equal to the age- and sex-specific 95th percentile of the Centers
            for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Logistic
            regressions adjusted for sex, race/ethnic group, poverty level, and
            survey year were conducted to describe associations between obesity
            and food insecurity.</p></div><div><head> RESULTS:</head><p>Obesity was significantly associated with personal food insecurity
            for children aged 6 to 11 years (odds ratio=1.81; 95% CI 1.33 to
            2.48), but not in children aged 2 to 5 years (odds ratio=0.88; 95%
            CI 0.51 to 1.51). Child-level food insecurity was not associated
            with obesity among 2- to 5-year-olds or 6- to 11-year-olds.</p></div><div><head> CONCLUSIONS:</head><p>Personal food insecurity is associated with an increased risk of
            obesity only in children aged 6 to 11 years. Personal
            food-insecurity measures may give different results than aggregate
            food-insecurity measures in children.</p></div></div></front></egXML></cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Content model</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2"><eg xml:space="preserve">

First, that no thief is to be spared who is caught with
            the stolen goods, [if he is] over twelve years and [if the value of the goods is] over
            eightpence.

                wergild — and the thief is to be no nearer a settlement on that account — or to
                clear himself by an oath of that amount.</item><item n="1.2">If, however, he [the thief] wishes to defend himself or to escape, he is
                not to be spared [whether younger or older than twelve].</item><item n="1.3">If a thief is put into prison, he is to be in prison 40 days, and he may
                then be redeemed with 120 shillings; and the kindred are to stand surety for him
                that he will desist for ever.</item><item n="1.4">And if he steals after that, they are to pay for him with his wergild,
                or to bring him back there.</item><item n="1.5">And if he steals after that, they are to pay for him with his wergild,
                whether to the king or to him to whom it rightly belongs; and everyone of those who
                supported him is to pay 120 shillings to the king as a fine.</item></list></item><item n="2">Concerning lordless men. And we pronounced about these lordless men, from whom
            no justice can be obtained, that one should order their kindred to fetch back such a
            person to justice and to find him a lord in public meeting.

                he is then to be a fugitive afterwards, and he who encounters him is to strike him
                down as a thief.</item><item n="2.2">And he who harbours him after that, is to pay for him with his wergild
                or to clear himself by an oath of that amount.</item></list></item><item n="3">Concerning the refusal of justice. The lord who refuses justice and upholds
            his guilty man, so that the king is appealed to, is to repay the value of the goods and
            120 shillings to the king; and he who appeals to the king before he demands justice as
            often as he ought, is to pay the same fine as the other would have done, if he had
            refused him justice.

                known about him, is to forfeit the slave and be liable to his wergild on the first
                occasionp if he does it more often, he is to be liable to pay all that he owns.</item><item n="3.2">And likewise any of the king's treasurers or of our reeves, who has been
                an accessory of thieves who have committed theft, is to liable to the same.</item></list></item><item n="4">Concerning treachery to a lord. And we have pronounced concerning treachery to

These codes consist of 4 letters, and it is recommended they be written with an initial capital, the other three letters in lower case. The canonical list of codes is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and is available at <ptr target="http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html"/>. The IETF recommends this code be omitted unless it is necessary to make a distinction you need.</item><label>region</label><item>Either an ISO 3166 country code or a UN M.49 region code that is registered with IANA (not all such codes are registered, e.g. UN codes for economic groupings or codes for countries for which there is already an ISO 3166 2-letter code are not registered). The former consist of 2 letters, and it is recommended they be written in upper case; the list of codes can be searched or browsed at <ptr target="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/"/>. The latter consist of 3 digits; the list of codes can be found at <ptr target="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm"/>.</item><label>variant</label><item>An IANA-registered variation. These codes <quote rend="quoted">are used to indicate additional, well-recognized variations that define a language or its dialects that are not covered by other available subtags</quote>.</item><label>extension</label><item>An extension has the format of a single letter followed by a hyphen followed by additional subtags.

These should be used with great care, since they interfere with the interoperability that use of RFC 4646 is intended to promote.
