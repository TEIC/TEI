    <head>Overall structure of a TEI text</head>
    <p>To introduce the structure of a TEI document, we'll begin at the level of a smaller text fragment, and then gradually add the larger document structure around it. 
    Our example is based on the <ref target="#liprograves">Diary of Robert Graves</ref>. For educational purposes, the encoding that we will show here is slightly different 
    from the encoding applied in that project.</p>
<div xml:id="osfra">
    <head>A text fragment </head>
    <p>Suppose we were to create an edition of the diary of Robert Graves. We have a facsimile of a diary page, which looks like this:</p>
    <figure>
        <figDesc>Page from the diary of Robert Graves, Oct. 10 1938</figDesc>
        <graphic url="images/graves1938-10-10.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>An initial transcription of the text might look like this:
        <eg>
            Oct 10 Monday
            Ghost, completing ch IX
            Dictionary with Alan.
            A lot of time goes to making 
            charcoal for 'Marthe', Beryl's 
            now using this fugon for warming 
            her attic.
            Went to Montauban with 
            David – first visit for about 
            10 days – ordered small wood for 
            Dorothy's cresset.
            Now almost always win at 
            Cambeluk: we are playing a 
            correspondence game with Harry.
            Nono broke Laura's particular 
            coffee cup,  [sketch of cup]  and she 
            her blue glass bottle given by 
            Karl.</eg>
    </p>
    <p>The first thing to remark here is that in a diary transcription we'll want to identify the date that the entry belongs to. We may also want to say that 
        this piece of text actually <emph>is</emph> a diary entry. The next thing we notice is that the entry has a heading (<q>Oct 10 Monday</q>) 
        and consists of a number of paragraphs. We introduce some XML elements and attributes to account for these facts. 
    </p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        <p>A lot of time goes to making

        <p>Went to Montauban with

        her blue glass bottle given by 
        Karl.</p>
        </div>
    </egXML>
    <p>The <gi>div</gi> element is what is used to describe textual divisions. We use here the <att>n</att> attribute to indicate the date, and the 
    <att>type</att> attribute to state this piece of text is a diary entry. <gi>head</gi> is used to describe a heading, <gi>p</gi>  describes a 
        paragraph. A question might be why we don't simply indicate paragraphs by newline characters, the way many programs do (such as 
        Notepad on Windows). One reason is that different operating systems use different characters to indicate the beginning of a new line. Another 
        reason is that an accidental new line character in our source would cause a rendering application to begin a new paragraph. The best way to 
        avoid ambiguity and to make our encoding portable between platforms is to explicitly indicate new paragraphs. We might, in fact, even have indicated 
        the locations where Graves begins a new line. TEI provides the <gi>lb</gi> element for that purpose. This, as most other 
        decisions about encoding, is a matter of editorial choice. Is the beginning of a new line important enough to be retained in an edition? The TEI 
        does not prescribe editorial policies.
    </p>
    <p>Before moving on to the larger document structure, we'll add a few more refinements. Not every project will find these refinements 
        necessary, but they give an indication of the kind of phenomena TEI can handle. To begin with, the word <q>fugon</q> is a word taken 
        from Spanish, and should probably be italicised in an edition. We use the <gi>foreign</gi> element to indicate this. To expain what it means, 
        we add a <gi>note</gi>. Then, there is a small drawing of a cup, which our transcription renders as <q>[sketch of cup]</q>. From the 
        transcription, no-one would know that these aren't Graves' own words. We will use a <gi>figure</gi> element and an embedded 
        <gi>figDesc</gi> (figure description) to place the description. We will also indicate that <q>ch</q> is an abbreviation. And finally, we will want 
        to indicate a number of changes that Graves made in his text. We will use <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi> elements to indicate deletions 
        and additions to the text. The result is as follows:</p>

    <p>Let's now put this fragment into context.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="oscon">
        <head>The larger document structure</head>
        <p>Texts do not live in isolation. They are often introduced by title pages, prefaces, tables of contents and dedications; they are often 
        followed by an index, appendices, and similar material. We represent this structure by a <gi>text</gi> element that contains a <gi>front</gi>, 
            <gi>body</gi> and <gi>back</gi>. In our case, the editors of Graves' correspondence have created monthly abstracts of the diary entries. 
            These might very well have been placed in the <gi>front</gi> element. Supposing for the moment that there is no other front matter and no 
            back matter, that would give us this:
        </p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                <front>

                        <p>The rains set in, and Graves works in his bedroom with the fire going. ...</p> 
                    </div>

                </body>
            </text>
        </egXML>
        <p>Notice, by the way, the use of <![CDATA[<!-- ...  -->]]> to write comments in XML text. Comments are used to explain something about the 
        encoding to a human reader and will usually be ignored by programs that process the XML.</p>
       <p>Apart from the texts that surround a main text, such as forewords and appendices, TEI texts are also provided with metadata, information 
           <emph>about</emph> the text. All TEI texts come with a header that contains these metadata. The element is called <gi>teiHeader</gi>. The 
           <gi>teiHeader</gi> and the <gi>text</gi> are children op the top level <gi>TEI</gi> element. So the overall structure looks like this:</p>

        <p>Notice the 'xmlns' on the <gi>TEI</gi> element: all TEI elements are part of the TEI <term target="getstartgloss.xml#ns">namespace</term>, 
            <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"/>. </p>
        <p>We will not go into details here about the content of the TEI header, but show a very minimal example. Again, this is borrowed, with simplifications, from 
            the <ref target="#liprograves">Diary of Robert Graves</ref>.</p>

        <head>Two refinements</head>
        <p>The encoding that we have shown up to now is of course only a very partial encoding. We will show two ways of creating a more informative

        <div xml:id="osreffac">
            <head>Attaching a facsimile</head>
            <p>First, we may want to make explicit the relation between the image file that we transcribed and the transcribed content. For that purpose, the TEI provides the 
            <gi>facsimile</gi> element, stored between the <gi>teiHeader</gi> and the <gi>text</gi> elements. 
            The <gi>facsimile</gi> element describes the transcribed object in terms of <gi>surface</gi>s and (optionally) 
            <gi>zone</gi>s within these surfaces. In our case, each surface will correspond with a diary page, and we have no need for zones. For each 
            surface, we can define one or more <gi>graphic</gi> elements,  which wil hold information about the images of that page. The surface element is provided 
            with an  <att>xml:id</att> attribute. From the transcription we can point at the <gi>surface</gi> using the <att>facs</att> attribute. Let's see what 
            this looks like:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <TEI>
                <teiHeader> ... </teiHeader>

                        <graphic url="graves1938-10-10.jpg"/>
                    </surface>
                </facsimile>
                <text>
                    <front>...</front>
                    <body>
                        <div type="diaryentry" n="1938-10-10" facs="#graves1938-10-10-1">
                            ...
                        </div>
                    </body>
                </text>
            </TEI>
        </egXML>
        <p>You see we have added a <gi>facsimile</gi> element containing a <gi>surface</gi> for the page that we transcribed. The <gi>surface</gi> has 
            an <att>xml:id</att> attribute. On the <gi>div</gi> element in the transcription we have added a <att>facs</att> attribute. The value of the <att>facs</att> 
            attribute is a <term target="getstartgloss.xml#url">url</term>. The value '#graves1938-10-10-1' points to the element with <att>xml:id</att> attribute 
            'graves1938-10-10-1', that is, the <gi>surface</gi> element. The <gi>surface</gi> element contains the <gi>graphic</gi> element that 
            is an image of the current page. 
        </p>
        <p>The reason we do this is that we have now explicitly defined the relation between the transcription and the corresponding image files. Later users of the 
            transcription will know what belongs together. What may be more important: applications that want to render the transcription will no longer need 
            to know about the names of the image files. They can just fetch the files that are needed from the location as it is specified in the Guidelines. It is an 
            important  step towards making general-purpose TEI applications. 
        </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="osrefper">
            <head>Repurposeable notes about persons</head>
            <p>A further enhancement of the document's value would be to provide some explanations about the many persons mentioned, 
                but not identified, in the diary entries. We could create <gi>note</gi> elements, the way we did to explain 
                <mentioned>fugon</mentioned>, but most persons recur many times throughout the diary. What we'd like to have is a single explanation 
                per person, that we can show whenever it is needed. </p>
            <p>One way to create such reusable explanations is to make use of the participant description in the TEI header. The 
                <gi>particDesc</gi> element can contain a list of persons (a <gi>listPerson</gi> element containing <gi>person</gi>s). For each 
                <gi>person</gi> we could, if we wanted to do so, give a structured description of a number of characteristics (sex, age, etc). But we can 
                also limit ourselves to an informal description using a <gi>p</gi> element. Whenever a specific person occurs in the diary, we can then 
                refer to the description of that person in the header. The element that we will use to refer to the description is the <gi>rs</gi> element. The 
                <gi>rs</gi> element 
                (referring string) is somewhat like a name element, but more generic: names are referring strings, but so are 
                'her oldest son' or 'the gardener'. Which gives us something like this:

            describes that text. The text itself (<gi>text</gi>) may, in addition to the text <gi>body</gi>, contain <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi> matter. 
            Additionally, a TEI encoded text may contain a <gi>facsimile</gi> element that relates the transcription to the pages that have been 
            transcribed and to images of that pages. The transcription itself is usually structured using <gi>div</gi> element for the textual divisions, 
            which in their turn will contain <gi>p</gi> elements (if we are dealing with prose). </p>
        <p>We also saw a number of extras: we identified abbreviations, we encoded additions and deletions, and annotated references to persons. As 
            said earlier, there is nothing in the TEI which obliges us to provide that information. Decisions about the whether to encode such 
            features depend, among other things, on the type of edition that is being planned, and the resources that are available. For those, however, that 
            want to encode them, the TEI provides the necessary mechanisms. </p>
        <p>But why do we provide our texts with this type  of encoding at all? Why don't we use 
            a <term target="getstartgloss.xml#wys">wysiwyg</term> editing environment, the way modern word processors do? The next section will discuss 
            why we believe the type of markup that we apply here is necessary for scholarly work.
