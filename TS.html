It should be stressed, however, that the present proposals are not intended to support unmodified every variety of research undertaken upon spoken material now or in the future; some discourse analysts, some phonologists, and doubtless others may wish to extend the scheme presented here to express more precisely the set of distinctions they wish to draw in their transcriptions. Speech regarded as a purely acoustic phenomenon may well require different methods from those outlined here, as may speech regarded solely as a process of social interaction. </p><p>This chapter begins with a discussion of some of the problems commonly encountered in transcribing spoken language (section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSOV" title="General Considerations and Overview"><span class="headingNumber">8.1 </span>General Considerations and Overview</a>). Section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#HD32" title="Documenting the Source of Transcribed Speech"><span class="headingNumber">8.2 </span>Documenting the Source of Transcribed Speech</a> documents some additional TEI header elements which may be used to document the recording or other source from which transcribed text is taken. Section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSBA" title="Elements Unique to Spoken Texts"><span class="headingNumber">8.3 </span>Elements Unique to Spoken Texts</a> describes the basic structural elements provided by this module. Finally, section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSSA" title="Elements Defined Elsewhere"><span class="headingNumber">8.4 </span>Elements Defined Elsewhere</a> of this chapter reviews further problems specific to the encoding of spoken language, demonstrating how mechanisms and elements discussed elsewhere in these Guidelines may be applied to them.</p><div class="div2" id="TSOV"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"></li><li class="subtoc"><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="TS.html#HD32"><span class="headingNumber">8.2 </span>Documenting the Source of Transcribed Speech</a></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h3><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#TSOV" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: General Considerations and Overview</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">8.1 </span><span class="head">General Considerations and Overview</span></h3><p>There is great variation in the ways different researchers have chosen to represent speech using the written medium.<span id="Note68_return"><a class="notelink" title="For a discussion of several of these see ; ; and ." href="#Note68"><sup>31</sup></a></span> This reflects the special difficulties which apply to the encoding or <span class="noindex">transcription</span> of speech. Speech varies according to a large number of dimensions, many of which have no counterpart in writing (for example, tempo, loudness, pitch, etc.). The audibility of speech recorded in natural communication situations is often less than perfect, affecting the accuracy of the transcription. Spoken material may be transcribed in the course of linguistic, acoustic, anthropological, psychological, ethnographic, journalistic, or many other types of research. Even in the same field, the interests and theoretical perspectives of different transcribers may lead them to prefer different levels of detail in the transcript and different styles of visual display. The production and comprehension of speech are intimately bound up with the situation in which speech occurs, far more so than is the case for written texts. A speech transcript must therefore include some contextual features; determining which are relevant is not always simple. Moreover, the ethical problems in recording and making public what was produced in a private setting and intended for a limited audience are more frequently encountered in dealing with spoken texts than with written ones.</p><p>Speech also poses difficult structural problems. Unlike a written text, a speech event takes place in time. Its beginning and end may be hard to determine and its internal composition difficult to define. Most researchers agree that the utterances or <span class="term">turns</span> of individual speakers form an important structural component in most kinds of speech, but these are rarely as well-behaved (in the structural sense) as paragraphs or other analogous units in written texts: speakers frequently interrupt each other, use gestures as well as words, leave remarks unfinished and so on. Speech itself, though it may be represented as words, frequently contains items such as vocalized pauses which, although only semi-lexical, have immense importance in the analysis of spoken text. Even non-vocal elements such as gestures may be regarded as forming a component of spoken text for some analytic purposes. Below the level of the individual utterance, speech may be segmented into units defined by phonological, prosodic, or syntactic phenomena; no clear agreement exists, however, even as to appropriate names for such segments.</p><p>Spoken texts transcribed according to the guidelines presented here are organized as follows. The overall structure of a TEI spoken text is identical to that of any other TEI text: the <a class="gi" title="(TEI document) contains a single TEI-conformant document, combining a single TEI header with one or more members of the model.resourceLike class. Multiple TEI elements may be combined to form a &lt;teiCorpus&gt; element." href="ref-TEI.html">TEI</a> element for a spoken text contains a <a class="gi" title="(TEI header) supplies descriptive and declarative metadata associated with a digital resource or set of resources." href="ref-teiHeader.html">teiHeader</a> element, followed by a <a class="gi" title="contains a single text of any kind, whether unitary or composite, for example a poem or drama, a collection of essays, a novel, a dictionary, or a corpus sample." href="ref-text.html">text</a> element. Even texts primarily composed of transcribed speech may also include conventional front and back matter, and may even be organized into divisions like printed texts.</p><p>We may say, therefore, that these Guidelines regard transcribed speech as being composed of arbitrary high-level units called <span class="noindex">texts</span>. A spoken <a class="gi" title="contains a single text of any kind, whether unitary or composite, for example a poem or drama, a collection of essays, a novel, a dictionary, or a corpus sample." href="ref-text.html">text</a> might typically be a conversation between a small number of people, a lecture, a broadcast TV item, or a similar event. Each such unit has associated with it a <a class="gi" title="(TEI header) supplies descriptive and declarative metadata associated with a digital resource or set of resources." href="ref-teiHeader.html">teiHeader</a> providing detailed contextual information such as the source of the transcript, the identity of the participants, whether the speech is scripted or spontaneous, the physical and social setting in which the discourse takes place and a range of other aspects. Details of the header in general are provided in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="HD.html" title="5"><span class="headingNumber">2 </span>The TEI Header</a>; the particular elements it provides for use with spoken texts are described below (<a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#HD32" title="Documenting the Source of Transcribed Speech"><span class="headingNumber">8.2 </span>Documenting the Source of Transcribed Speech</a>). Details concerning additional elements which may be used for the documentation of participant and contextual information are given in <a class="link_ptr" href="CC.html#CCAH" title="Contextual Information"><span class="headingNumber">15.2 </span>Contextual Information</a>.</p><p>Defining the bounds of a spoken text is frequently a matter of arbitrary convention or convenience. In public or semi-public contexts, a text may be regarded as synonymous with, for example, a <span class="noindex">lecture</span>, a <span class="noindex">broadcast item</span>, a <span class="noindex">meeting</span>, etc. In informal or private contexts, a text may be simply a conversation involving a specific group of participants. Alternatively, researchers may elect to define spoken texts solely in terms of their duration in time or length in words. By default, these Guidelines assume of a text only that: </p><ul class="bulleted"><li class="item">it is internally cohesive,</li><li class="item">it is describable by a single header, and</li><li class="item">it represents a single stretch of time with no significant discontinuities.</li></ul><p> Deviation from these assumptions may be specified (for example, the <span class="att">org</span> attribute on the <a class="gi" title="contains a single text of any kind, whether unitary or composite, for example a poem or drama, a collection of essays, a novel, a dictionary, or a corpus sample." href="ref-text.html">text</a> element may take the value <span class="val">compos</span> to specify that the components of the text are discrete) but is not recommended.</p><p>Within a <a class="gi" title="contains a single text of any kind, whether unitary or composite, for example a poem or drama, a collection of essays, a novel, a dictionary, or a corpus sample." href="ref-text.html">text</a> it may be necessary to identify subdivisions of various kinds, if only for convenience of handling. The neutral <a class="gi" title="(text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text." href="ref-div.html">div</a> element discussed in section <a class="link_ptr" href="DS.html#DSDIV" title="Divisions of the Body"><span class="headingNumber">4.1 </span>Divisions of the Body</a> is recommended for this purpose. It may be found useful also for representing subdivisions relating to discourse structure, speech act theory, transactional analysis, etc., provided only that these divisions are hierarchically well-behaved. Where they are not, as is often the case, the mechanisms discussed in chapters <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html" title="14"><span class="headingNumber">16 </span>Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment</a> and <a class="link_ptr" href="NH.html" title="31"><span class="headingNumber">20 </span>Non-hierarchical Structures</a> may be used.</p><p>A spoken text may contain any of the following components: </p><ul class="bulleted"><li class="item">utterances</li><li class="item">pauses</li><li class="item">vocalized but non-lexical phenomena such as coughs</li><li class="item">kinesic (non-verbal, non-lexical) phenomena such as gestures</li><li class="item">entirely non-linguistic incidents occurring during and possibly influencing the course of speech</li><li class="item">writing, regarded as a special class of incident in that it can be transcribed, for example captions or overheads displayed during a lecture</li><li class="item">shifts or changes in vocal quality</li></ul><p>Elements to represent all of these features of spoken language are discussed in section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSBA" title="Elements Unique to Spoken Texts"><span class="headingNumber">8.3 </span>Elements Unique to Spoken Texts</a> below.</p><p>An utterance (tagged <a class="gi" title="(utterance) contains a stretch of speech usually preceded and followed by silence or by a change of speaker." href="ref-u.html">u</a>) may contain lexical items interspersed with pauses and non-lexical vocal sounds; during an utterance, non-linguistic incidents may occur and written materials may be presented. The <a class="gi" title="(utterance) contains a stretch of speech usually preceded and followed by silence or by a change of speaker." href="ref-u.html">u</a> element can thus contain any of the other elements listed, interspersed with a transcription of the lexical items of the utterance; the other elements may all appear between utterances or next to each other, but except for <a class="gi" title="contains a passage of written text revealed to participants in the course of a spoken text." href="ref-writing.html">writing</a> they do not contain any other elements nor any data.</p><p>A spoken text itself may be without substructure, that is, it may consist simply of units such as utterances or pauses, not grouped together in any way, or it may be subdivided. If the notion of what constitutes a ‘text’ in spoken discourse is inevitably rather an arbitrary one, the notion of formal subdivisions within such a ‘text’ may appear even more debatable. Nevertheless, such divisions may be useful for such types of discourse as debates, broadcasts, etc., where structural subdivisions can easily be identified, or more generally wherever it is desired to aggregate utterances or other parts of a transcript into units smaller than a complete ‘text’. Examples might include <span class="q">‘conversations’</span> or <span class="q">‘discourse fragments’</span>, or more narrowly, <span class="q">‘that part of the conversation where topic x was discussed’</span>, provided only that the set of all such divisions is coextensive with the text.</p><div class="p">Each such division of a spoken text should be represented by the numbered or unnumbered <a class="gi" title="(text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text." href="ref-div.html">div</a> elements defined in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="DS.html" title="7"><span class="headingNumber">4 </span>Default Text Structure</a>. For some detailed kinds of analysis a hierarchy of such divisions may be found useful; nested <a class="gi" title="(text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text." href="ref-div.html">div</a> elements may be used for this purpose, as in the following example showing how a collection made up of transcribed ‘sound bites’ taken from speeches given by a politician on different occasions might be encoded. Each extract is regarded as a distinct <a class="gi" title="(text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text." href="ref-div.html">div</a>, nested within a single composite <a class="gi" title="(text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text." href="ref-div.html">div</a> as follows: <div id="index-egXML-d50e66694" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;div <span class="attribute">type</span>="<span class="attributevalue">soundbites</span>"<br /> <span class="attribute">subtype</span>="<span class="attributevalue">conservative</span>" <span class="attribute">org</span>="<span class="attributevalue">composite</span>"&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;div <span class="attribute">sample</span>="<span class="attributevalue">medial</span>"/&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;div <span class="attribute">sample</span>="<span class="attributevalue">medial</span>"/&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;div <span class="attribute">sample</span>="<span class="attributevalue">initial</span>"/&gt;</span><br /><span class="element">&lt;/div&gt;</span></div></div><p>As a member of the class <a class="link_odd" title="provides attributes for elements which may be independently associated with a particular declarable element within the header, thus overriding the inherited default for that element." href="ref-att.declaring.html">att.declaring</a>, the <a class="gi" title="(text division) contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text." href="ref-div.html">div</a> element may also carry a <span class="att">decls</span> attribute, for use where the divisions of a text do not all share the same set of the contextual declarations specified in the TEI header.

As a very simple example, consider the following, first as it might be represented in a playscript: <div id="index-egXML-d50e69450" class="pre cdata egXML_valid"> Jane: Have you read Vanity Fair?
Stig: Yes
Lou: (nods vigorously)</div> To encode this, we first define the participants: <div id="index-egXML-d50e69453" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;listPerson&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;person <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">stig</span>"&gt;</span><br /><span class="comment">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;/person&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;person <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">lou</span>"&gt;</span><br /><span class="comment">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;/person&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;person <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">jane</span>"&gt;</span><br /><span class="comment">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;/person&gt;</span><br /><span class="element">&lt;/listPerson&gt;</span></div> Let us assume that Stig and Lou respond to Jane's question before she has finished asking it—a fairly normal situation in spontaneous speech. The simplest way of representing this <span class="term">overlap</span> would be to use the <span class="att">trans</span> attribute previously discussed: <div id="index-egXML-d50e69468" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;u <span class="attribute">who</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#jane</span>"&gt;</span>have you read Vanity Fair<span class="element">&lt;/u&gt;</span><br /><span class="element">&lt;u <span class="attribute">trans</span>="<span class="attributevalue">overlap</span>" <span class="attribute">who</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#stig</span>"&gt;</span>yes<span class="element">&lt;/u&gt;</span></div> However, this does not allow us to indicate either the extent to which Stig's utterance is overlapped, nor does it show that there are in fact three things which are synchronous: the end of Jane's utterance, Stig's whole utterance, and Lou's kinesic. To overcome these problems, more sophisticated techniques, employing the mechanisms for pointing and alignment discussed in detail in section <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html#SASY" title="Synchronization"><span class="headingNumber">16.4 </span>Synchronization</a>, are needed. If the module for linking has been enabled (as described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSSASE" title="Segmentation"><span class="headingNumber">8.4.1 </span>Segmentation</a> above), one way to represent the simple example above would be as follows: <div id="index-egXML-d50e69479" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;u <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">utt1</span>" <span class="attribute">who</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#jane</span>"&gt;</span>have you read Vanity <span class="element">&lt;anchor <span class="attribute">synch</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#utt2 #k1</span>" <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">a1</span>"/&gt;</span> Fair<span class="element">&lt;/u&gt;</span><br /><span class="element">&lt;u <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">utt2</span>" <span class="attribute">who</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#stig</span>"&gt;</span>yes<span class="element">&lt;/u&gt;</span><br /><span class="element">&lt;kinesic <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">k1</span>" <span class="attribute">who</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#lou</span>"<br /> <span class="attribute">iterated</span>="<span class="attributevalue">true</span>"&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;desc&gt;</span>nods head vertically<span class="element">&lt;/desc&gt;</span><br /><span class="element">&lt;/kinesic&gt;</span></div></div><p>For a full discussion of this and related mechanisms, section <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html#SASYMP" title="Placing Synchronous Events in Time"><span class="headingNumber">16.4.2 </span>Placing Synchronous Events in Time</a> should be consulted. The rest of the present section, which should be read in conjunction with that more detailed discussion, presents a number of ways in which these mechanisms may be applied to the specific problem of representing temporal alignment, synchrony, or overlap in transcribing spoken texts.</p><p>In the simple example above, the first utterance (that with identifier <span class="val">utt1</span>) contains an <a class="gi" title="(anchor point) attaches an identifier to a point within a text, whether or not it corresponds with a textual element." href="ref-anchor.html">anchor</a> element, the function of which is simply to mark a point within it. The <span class="att">synch</span> attribute associated with this anchor point specifies the identifiers of the other two elements which are to be synchronized with it: specifically, the second utterance (<span class="val">utt2</span>) and the kinesic (k1). Note that one of these elements has content and the other is empty.</p><p>This example demonstrates only a way of indicating a point within one utterance at which it can be synchronized with another utterance and a kinesic. For more complex kinds of alignment, involving possibly multiple synchronization points, an additional element is provided, known as a <a class="gi" title="provides a set of ordered points in time which can be linked to elements of a spoken text to create a temporal alignment of that text." href="ref-timeline.html">timeline</a>. This consists of a series of <a class="gi" title="indicates a point in time either relative to other elements in the same timeline tag, or absolutely." href="ref-when.html">when</a> elements, each representing a point in time, and bearing attributes which indicate its exact temporal position relative to other elements in the same timeline, in addition to the sequencing implied by its position within it.</p><div class="p">For example: <div id="index-egXML-d50e69517" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;timeline <span class="attribute">unit</span>="<span class="attributevalue">s</span>" <span class="attribute">origin</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#TS-P1</span>"&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;when <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">TS-P1</span>"<br />  <span class="attribute">absolute</span>="<span class="attributevalue">12:20:01+01:00</span>"/&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;when <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">TS-P2</span>" <span class="attribute">interval</span>="<span class="attributevalue">4.5</span>"<br />  <span class="attribute">since</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#TS-P1</span>"/&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;when <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">TS-P6</span>"/&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;when <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">TS-P3</span>" <span class="attribute">interval</span>="<span class="attributevalue">1.5</span>"<br />  <span class="attribute">since</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#TS-P6</span>"/&gt;</span><br /><span class="element">&lt;/timeline&gt;</span></div> This timeline represents four points in time, named TS-P1, TS-P2, TS-P6, and TS-P3 (as with all attributes named <span class="att">xml:id</span> in the TEI scheme, the names must be unique within the document but have no other significance). TS-P1 is located absolutely, at 12:20:01:01 BST. TS-P2 is 4.5 seconds later than TS-P2 (i.e. at 12:20:46). TS-P6 is at some unspecified time later than TS-P2 and previous to TS-P3 (this is implied by its position within the timeline, as no attribute values have been specified for it).

Particularly when dealing with informal, dialectal, or other varieties of language, the transcriber will frequently have to decide whether a particular sound is to be treated as a distinct vocabulary item or not. For example, while in a given project <span class="mentioned">kinda</span> may not be worth distinguishing as a vocabulary item from <span class="mentioned">kind of</span>, <span class="mentioned">isn't</span> may clearly be worth distinguishing from <span class="mentioned">is not</span>; for some purposes, the regional variant <span class="mentioned">isnae</span> might also be worth distinguishing in the same way.</p><p>One rule of thumb might be to allow such variation only where a generally accepted orthographic form exists, for example, in published dictionaries of the language register being encoded; this has the disadvantage that such dictionaries may not exist. Another is to maintain a controlled (but extensible) set of normalized forms for all such words; this has the advantage of enforcing some degree of consistency among different transcribers. Occasionally, as for example when transcribing abbreviations or acronyms, it may be felt necessary to depart from conventional spelling to distinguish between cases where the abbreviation is spelled out letter by letter (e.g. <span class="mentioned">B B C</span> or <span class="mentioned">V A T</span>) and where it is pronounced as a single word (<span class="mentioned">VAT</span> or <span class="mentioned">RADA</span>). Similar considerations might apply to pronunciation of foreign words (e.g. <span class="mentioned">Monsewer</span> vs. <span class="mentioned">Monsieur</span>).</p><p>In general, use of punctuation, capitalization, etc., in spoken transcripts should be carefully controlled. It is important to distinguish the transcriber's intuition as to what the punctuation should be from the marking of prosodic features such as pausing, intonation, etc.</p><p>Whatever practice is adopted, it is essential that it be clearly and fully documented in the editorial declarations section of the header. It may also be found helpful to include normalized forms of non-conventional spellings within the text, using the elements for simple editorial changes described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html#COED" title="Simple Editorial Changes"><span class="headingNumber">3.4 </span>Simple Editorial Changes</a> (see further section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSTPSM" title="Speech Management"><span class="headingNumber">8.4.5 </span>Speech Management</a>).</p></div><div class="div3" id="TSTPPR"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"><span class="previousLink"> « </span><a class="navigation" href="TS.html#TSREG"><span class="headingNumber">8.4.3 </span>Regularization of Word Forms</a></li><li class="subtoc"><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="TS.html#TSTPSM"><span class="headingNumber">8.4.5 </span>Speech Management</a></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h4><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#TSTPPR" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: Prosody</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">8.4.4 </span><span class="head">Prosody</span></h4><p>In the absence of conventional punctuation, the marking of prosodic features assumes paramount importance, since these structure and organize the spoken message. Indeed, such prosodic features as points of primary or secondary stress may be represented by specialized punctuation marks, or other characters such as those provided by the Unicode Spacing Modifier Letters block. Pauses have already been dealt with in section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSBAPA" title="Pausing"><span class="headingNumber">8.3.2 </span>Pausing</a>; while tone units (or intonational phrases) can be indicated by the segmentation tag discussed in section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSSASE" title="Segmentation"><span class="headingNumber">8.4.1 </span>Segmentation</a>. The <a class="gi" title="marks the point at which some paralinguistic feature of a series of utterances by any one speaker changes." href="ref-shift.html">shift</a> element discussed in section <a class="link_ptr" href="TS.html#TSSASH" title="Shifts"><span class="headingNumber">8.3.6 </span>Shifts</a> may also be used to encode some prosodic features, for example where all that is required is the ability to record shifts in voice quality.</p><p>In a more detailed phonological transcript, it is common practice to include a number of conventional signs to mark prosodic features of the surrounding or (more usually) preceding speech. Such signs may be used to record, for example, particular intonation patterns, truncation, vowel quality (long or short) etc. These signs may be preserved in a transcript either by using conventional punctuation or by marking their presence by <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> elements. Where a transcript includes many phonetic or phonemic aspects, it will generally be more convenient to use the appropriate Unicode characters (see further chapters <a class="link_ptr" href="CH.html" title="4"><span class="headingNumber">vi. </span>Languages and Character Sets</a> and <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html" title="25"><span class="headingNumber">5 </span>Characters, Glyphs, and Writing Modes</a>).

here only concern the establishment of a basic text. Where a more sophisticated analysis is needed, more sophisticated methods of markup will also be appropriate, for example, using stand-off markup to indicate multiple segmentation of the stream of discourse, or complex alignment of several segments within it. Where additional annotations (sometimes called ‘codes’ or ‘tags’) are used to represent such features as linguistic word class (noun, verb, etc.), type of speech act (imperative, concessive, etc.), or information status (theme/rheme, given/new, active/semi-active/new), etc., a selection from the general purpose analytic tools discussed in chapters <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html" title="14"><span class="headingNumber">16 </span>Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment</a>, <a class="link_ptr" href="AI.html" title="15"><span class="headingNumber">17 </span>Simple Analytic Mechanisms</a>, and <a class="link_ptr" href="FS.html" title="16"><span class="headingNumber">18 </span>Feature Structures</a> may be used to advantage.</p><p>The general-purpose <a class="gi" title="groups together various annotations, e.g. for parallel interpretations of a spoken segment." href="ref-annotationBlock.html">annotationBlock</a> element may be used to group together a transcription and multiple layers of annotation.
