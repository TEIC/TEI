<rng:data type="token"/>
</content>
<remarks>
    <p>Typically, the list of documented possibilities will be
    provided (or exemplified) by a value list in the associated
    element specification. If the value contains whitespace, it must
    be normalised: neither leading or trailing sequences of whitespace
    characters nor internal sequences of more than one whitespace character are allowed.
