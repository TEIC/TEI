<head>Print Dictionaries</head>
<p>This chapter defines a base tag set for encoding human-oriented
monolingual and multilingual dictionaries (as opposed to computational
lexica, which are intended for use by language-processing
software). Dictionaries are most familiar in their printed form;
however, increasing numbers of dictionaries exist also in electronic
forms which are independent of any particular printed form, but from
which various displays can be produced — e.g. CD-ROM
dictionaries. </p>
    <p>Both typographically and structurally, dictionaries are extremely complex. In addition,
dictionaries interest many communities with different and sometimes conflicting goals. As a
result, many general problems of text encoding are particularly pronounced here, and more
compromises and alternatives within the encoding scheme may be required.<note place="foot">We refer the reader to previous and current discussions of a common format
    for encoding dictionaries. For example,<bibl>Robert A. Amsler and Frank W. Tompa, <title level="a">An SGML-Based Standard for English Monolingual Dictionaries,</title>

    <title level="a">Electronic dictionary encoding: customizing the TEI
Guidelines</title>, in <title>Proceedings of the Eighth Euralex International
Congress</title>, 1998</bibl>.</note> Two problems are particularly prominent.</p>
    <p>First, because the structure of dictionary entries varies widely both among and within
dictionaries, the simplest way for an encoding scheme to accommodate the entire range of
structures actually encountered is to allow virtually any element to appear virtually
anywhere in a dictionary entry. It is clear, however, that strong and consistent structural
principles do govern the vast majority of conventional dictionaries, as well as many or most
entries even in more <soCalled>exotic</soCalled> dictionaries; ideally, a set of encoding
guidelines should capture these structural principles. We therefore define two distinct
elements for dictionary entries, one (<gi>entry</gi>) which captures the regularities of
most conventional dictionary entries, and a second (<gi>entryFree</gi>) which uses the same
elements, but allows them to combine much more freely. It is recommended that <gi>entry</gi>
be used in preference to<gi>entryFree</gi> wherever the structure of the entry allows it.
These elements and their contents are described in sections <ptr target="#DIEN"/>, <ptr target="#DIFR"/>, and <ptr target="#DIHW"/>.</p>
    <p>Second, since so much of the information in printed dictionaries is implicit or highly
compressed, their encoding requires clear thought about whether it is to capture the precise
typographic form of the source text or the underlying structure of the information it
presents. Since both of these views of the dictionary may be of interest, it proves
necessary to develop methods of recording both, and of recording the interrelationship
between them as well. Users interested mainly in the printed format of the dictionary will
require an encoding to be faithful to an original printed version. However, other users will
be interested primarily in capturing the lexical information in a dictionary in a form
suitable for further processing, which may demand the expansion or rearrangement of the
information contained in the printed form. Further, some users wish to
encode<emph>both</emph> of these views of the data, and retain the links between related
elements of the two encodings. Problems of recording these two different views of dictionary
data are discussed in section<ptr target="#DIMV"/>, together with mechanisms for retaining
both views when this is desired.</p>
    <p>To deal with this complexity, and in particular to account for the wide variety of linguistic
context within within which a dictinoray may be designed, it can be necessary to use the
extension capabilities offered by the ODD environment (see chapter <ptr target="#TD"/>) to
provide more restriction or possibly alternate content models for the tags defined in this
chapter. The corresponding mechanisms will be exemplified in this chapter to illustrate the
provision of a closed set of values for grammatical descriptors (see <ptr target="#DITPGR"/>).</p>
    <p>In order to use the elements defined in this chapter in your own TEI environment you can
adopt one of the two following mechanisms:</p>
    <list>
<item>Create a schema in ODD format that comprises a reference to the Print Dictionary
    chapter as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<schemaSpec ident="myDict.odd">
    <moduleRef key="teistructure"/>
    <moduleRef key="teiheader"/>
    <moduleRef key="dictionaries"/>
</schemaSpec>
    </egXML> and compile it to generate a full DTD, RelaxNG Schema or W3C XML Schema; </item>
<item>Directly include the RelaxNG schema associated with this chapter in your main schema
    file, as follows: <eg> namespace ns1 = "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" # RELAX NG
grammar include "relaxng.rnc" # base TEI include "Schema/tei.rnc" # TEI modules
include "Schema/core.rnc" include "Schema/textstructure.rnc" include
"Schema/header.rnc" include "Schema/dictionaries.rnc" anyTEI = element ns1:* {
(attribute * { text } | text | anyTEI | macro.schemapattern)* } include
"Schema/tagdocs.rnc" { macro.schemapattern = text | pattern+ egXML.content = (text |
anyTEI | pattern )+ } include "Schema/linking.rnc" start |= elementSpec | classSpec
| macroSpec | div1 | div2 </eg>
</item>
    </list>
    <div type="div2" xml:id="DIBO">
<head>Dictionary Body and Overall Structure</head>
<p>Overall, dictionaries have the same structure of front matter, body, and back matter
    familiar from other texts; the base tag set for dictionaries uses the same front-matter
    and back-matter elements as other TEI base tag sets; these are documented in chapter
<ptr target="#DS"/>. In addition, dictionaries define the elements<gi>entry</gi>,
    <gi>entryFree</gi>, and <gi>superEntry</gi> as component-level elements which can occur
    directly within a text division or the text body. </p>
<p>The following tags should be used to mark the gross structure of a printed dictionary;
    the dictionary-specific tags are discussed further in the following section.<specList>
<specDesc key="text"/>
<specDesc key="front"/>
<specDesc key="body"/>
<specDesc key="back"/>
<specDesc key="div"/>
<specDesc key="entry"/>
<specDesc key="entryFree"/>
<specDesc key="superEntry"/>
    </specList> The text-division elements <gi>div1</gi> through <gi>div7</gi> may also be
    used, as described in chapter <ptr target="#DS"/>. </p>
<p>As members of the class <ident type="class">att.entryLike</ident>,<gi>entry</gi> and
    <gi>entryFree</gi> share the following attributes:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.entryLike" atts="type sortKey"/>
    </specList>
</p>
<p>The front and back matter of a dictionary may well contain specialized material like
    lists of common and proper nouns, grammatical tables, gazetteers, a <soCalled>guide to
the use of the dictionary</soCalled>, etc. These may be tagged as elements defined
    in the core tag set (chapter <ptr target="#CO"/>) or as specialized dictionary elements
    as defined in this chapter.</p>
<p>The <gi>body</gi> element consists of a set of <term>entries</term>, optionally grouped
    into one or several <gi>div</gi> or<gi>div1</gi> elements. These text
    divisions might correspond, for example, to sections for different languages in
    bilingual dictionaries, sections for different letters of the alphabet, etc.<note place="foot">It is unlikely that many conventional dictionaries will require smaller
divisions, but all the usual division elements<gi>div2</gi> through <gi>div7</gi>
may be used.</note> In print dictionaries, entries are typically typographically
    distinct entities, each headed by some morphological form of the lexical item described
    (the <term>headword</term>), and sorted in alphabetical order or (especially for
    non-alphabetic scripts) in some other conventional sequence. Dictionary entries should
    be encoded as distinct successive items, each marked as an <gi>entry</gi> element. The
    <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish different types of entries, for
    example main entries, related entries, run-on entries, or entries for cross-references,
    etc. </p>
<p>Some dictionaries provide distinct entries for homographs, on the basis of etymology,
    part-of-speech, or both, and typically provide a numeric superscript on the headword
    identifying the homograph number. In these cases each homograph should be encoded as a
    separate entry; the<gi>superEntry</gi> element may optionally be used to group such
    successive homograph entries. In addition to a series of <gi>entry</gi> elements, the
    <gi>superEntry</gi> may contain a preliminary <gi>form</gi> group (see section <ptr target="#DITPFO"/>) when information about hyphenation, pronunciation, etc., is given
    only once for two or more homograph entries. If the homograph number is to be recorded,
    the global attribute <att>n</att> should be used for this purpose. In some dictionaries,
    homographs are treated in distinct parts of the same entry; in these cases, they may be
    separated by use of the <gi>hom</gi> element, for which see section <ptr target="#DIENHI"/>. </p>
<p>A sort key, given in the <att>key</att> attribute, is often required for superentries and
    entries, especially in cases where the order of entries does not follow the local
    character-set collating sequence (as, for example, when an entry for <q>3D</q> appears
    at the place where<q>three-D</q> would appear). </p>
<p>The body of a bilingual dictionary with two parts will thus have an overall structure
    resembling the following:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<body>
    <div type="dictionary">
<entry/>
<entry/>
<entry/>
    </div>
    <div type="dictionary">
<entry/>
<entry/>
<entry/>
    </div>
</body>
    </egXML>
</p>
<p>A dictionary with no internal divisions might have a structure like the following; a
    <gi>superEntry</gi> is shown grouping two homograph entries.<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<body>
    <entry/>
    <entry/>
    <superEntry>
<entry type="hom" n="1"/>
<entry type="hom" n="2"/>
    </superEntry>
</body>
    </egXML>
</p>
<p>The base tag set for dictionaries is contained in the <ident type="file">dictionaries</ident> module. These define the class <ident type="class">model.entryLike</ident>, so that the generic text-division elements
    <gi>div</gi>, <gi>div1</gi>, etc. can contain <gi>entry</gi> elements.</p>

<head>The Structure of Dictionary Entries</head>
<p>A simple dictionary entry may contain information about the form of the word treated, its
    grammatical characterization, its definition, synonyms, or translation equivalents, its
    etymology, cross-references to other entries, usage information, and examples. These we
    refer to as the <term>constituent parts</term> or <term>constituents</term> of the
    entry; some dictionary constituents possess no internal structure, while others are most
    naturally viewed as groups of smaller elements, which may be marked in their own right.
    In some styles of markup, tags will be applied only to the low-level items, leaving the
    constituent groups which contain them untagged. We distinguish the class
of<term>top-level constituents</term> of dictionary entries, which can occur
    directly within entries, from the class of<term>phrase-level</term> constituents, which
    can normally occur only within top-level constituents. The top-level constituents of
    dictionary entries are described in section <ptr target="#DIENGP"/>, and documented more
    fully, together with their phrase-level sub-constituents, in section <ptr target="#DITP"/>. </p>
<p>In addition, however, dictionary entries often have a complex
hierarchical structure. For example, an entry may consist of two or
more sub-parts, each corresponding to information for a different
part-of-speech homograph of the headword. The entry (or part-of-speech
homographs, if the entry is split this way) may also consist of
senses, each of which may in turn be composed of two or more
sub-senses, etc. Each sub-part, homograph entry, sense, or sub-sense
we call a <term>level</term>; at any level in an entry, any or all of
the constituent parts of dictionary entries may appear. The
hierarchical levels of dictionary entries are documented in section
<ptr target="#DIENHI"/>. </p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DIENHI">
    <head>Hierarchical Levels</head>
    <p>The outermost structural level of an entry is marked with the elements <gi>entry</gi>
or <gi>entryFree</gi>. The <gi>hom</gi> element marks the subdivision of entries
into homographs differing in their part-of-speech. The<gi>sense</gi> element marks
the subdivision of entries and part-of-speech homographs into senses; this element
nests recursively in order to provide for a hierarchy of sub-senses of any depth.
All of these levels may each contain any of the constituent parts of an entry. A
special case of hierarchical structure is represented by the<gi>re</gi> (related
entry) element, which is discussed in section<ptr target="#DITPRE"/>. Finally, the
element <gi>dictScrap</gi> may be used at any point in the hierarchy to delimit
parts of the dictionary entry which are structurally anomalous, as further discussed
in section <ptr target="#DIFR"/>.<specList>
    <specDesc key="entry"/>
    <specDesc key="entryFree"/>
    <specDesc key="hom"/>
    <specDesc key="sense" atts="level"/>
    <specDesc key="dictScrap"/>
</specList>
    </p>
    <p>For example, an entry with two senses will have the following structure:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <entry>
<sense n="1"/>
<sense n="2"/>
    </entry>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>An entry with two homographs, the first with two senses and the second with three
(one of which has two sub-senses), may have a structure like this:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <entry>
<hom n="1">
    <sense n="1"> ... </sense>
    <sense n="2"> ... </sense>
</hom>
<hom n="2">
    <sense n="1">
<sense n="a"> ... </sense>
<sense n="b"> ... </sense>
    </sense>
    <sense n="2"> ... </sense>
    <sense n="3"> ... </sense>
</hom>
    </entry>
</egXML> In some dictionaries, homographs typically receive separate entries; in
such a case, as noted in section <ptr target="#DIBO"/>, the two homographs may be
treated as entries, optionally grouped by a <gi>superEntry</gi>:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <superEntry>
<entry n="1">
    <sense n="1"> ... </sense>
    <sense n="2"> ... </sense>
</entry>
<entry n="2">
    <sense n="1">
<sense n="a"> ... </sense>
<sense n="b"> ... </sense>
    </sense>
    <sense n="2"> ... </sense>
    <sense n="3"> ... </sense>
</entry>
    </superEntry>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>The hierarchical levels of dictionary entries are declared as shown in the following
DTD fragment. As may be seen, the content model for<gi>entry</gi> specifies that
entries do not nest, that homographs nest within entries, and that senses nest
within entries, homographs, or senses, and may be nested to any depth to reflect the
embedding of sub-senses. Any of the top-level constituents
(<gi>def</gi>,<gi>usg</gi>, <gi>form</gi>, etc.) can appear at any level (i.e.,
within entries, homographs, or senses).<specGrp xml:id="DDIEN" n="Dictionary entries and their structure">

    </p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DIENGP">
    <head>Groups and Constituents</head>
    <p>As noted above, dictionary entries, and subordinate levels within dictionary entries,
may comprise several constituent parts, each providing a different type of
information about the word treated. The<term>top-level constituents</term> of
dictionary entries are:<list type="bullets">
    <item>information about the form of the word treated (orthography,
pronunciation, hyphenation, etc.)</item>
    <item>grammatical information (part of speech, grammatical sub-categorization, etc.)</item>
    <item>definitions or translations into another language</item>
    <item>etymology</item>
    <item>examples</item>
    <item>usage information</item>
    <item>cross-references to other entries</item>
    <item>notes</item>
    <item>entries (often of reduced form) for related words, typically called
    <term>related entries</term>
    </item>
</list> Any of the hierarchical levels (<gi>entry</gi>,
<gi>entryFree</gi>,<gi>hom</gi>, <gi>sense</gi>) may contain any of these top-level
constituents, since information about word form, particular grammatical information,
special pronunciation, usage information, etc., may apply to an entire entry, or to
only one homograph, or only to a particular sense. The examples below illustrate
this point. </p>
    <p>The following elements are used to encode these top-level constituents:<specList>
    <specDesc key="form"/>
    <specDesc key="gramGrp"/>
    <specDesc key="def"/>
    <specDesc key="dicteg"/>
    <specDesc key="usg"/>

    <specDesc key="etym"/>
    <specDesc key="re"/>
    <specDesc key="note"/>
</specList>
    </p>
    <p>In a simple entry with no internal hierarchy, all top-level constituents appear at
the <gi>entry</gi> level.<note place="foot"> Each example taken from a real

    <head>Information on Written and Spoken Forms</head>
    <p>Dictionary entries most often begin with information about the form of the word to
which the entry applies. Typically, the orthographic form of the word, sometimes
marked for syllabification or hyphenation, is the first item in an entry. Other
information about the word, including variant or alternate forms, inflected forms,
pronunciation, etc., is also often given. </p>
    <p>The following elements should be used to encode this information: the <gi>form</gi>
element groups one or more occurrences of any of the others; it can also be
recursively nested to reflect more complex sub-grouping of information about word
form(s), as shown in the examples.<specList>
    <specDesc key="form" atts="type"/>
    <specDesc key="orth" atts="type extent"/>
    <specDesc key="pron" atts="extent"/>
    <specDesc key="hyph"/>
    <specDesc key="syll"/>
    <specDesc key="stress"/>
    <specDesc key="lbl"/>
</specList>
    </p>
    <p>In addition to those listed above, the following elements, which encode morphological
details of the form, may also occur within<gi>form</gi> elements:<specList>
    <specDesc key="gram" atts="type"/>
    <specDesc key="gen"/>
    <specDesc key="number"/>
    <specDesc key="case"/>
    <specDesc key="per"/>
    <specDesc key="tns"/>
    <specDesc key="mood"/>
    <specDesc key="iType" atts="type"/>
</specList> Of these, the <gi>gram</gi> element is most general, and all of the
others are synonymous with <gi>gram</gi> elements with appropriate values (<val>gen, number, case</val>, etc.) for the<att>type</att> attribute. </p>
    <p>Different dictionaries use different means to mark hyphenation, syllabification, and
stress, and they often use some unusual glyphs (e.g., the <soCalled>middle
dot</soCalled> for hyphenation). All of these glyphs should however be available in
the Unicode character set, and may be represented using either the standard ISO name
or an appropriate character entity reference, as discussed in <ptr target="#SG-cer"/>. When transcribing representations of pronunciation the
International Phonetic Alphabet should be used. It may be convenient (as has been
done in the text of this chapter) to use a simple transliteration scheme for the
phonetic transcription scheme employed; such a scheme should however be properly
documented in the header. </p>
    <p>In the simplest case, nothing is given but the orthography:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <form>
<orth>doom-laden</orth>
    </form>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>Often, however, pronunciation is given.<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">soucoupe</hi> [sukup] ... [DNT]</q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <form>
<orth>soucoupe</orth>
<pron>sukup</pron>
    </form>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>For a variety of reasons including ease of processing, it may be desired to split
into separate elements information which is collapsed into a single element in the
source text; orthography and hyphenation may for example be transcribed as separate
elements, although given together in the source text. For a discussion of the issues
involved, and of methods for retaining both the presentation form and the
interpreted form, see section <ptr target="#DIMV"/>. </p>
    <p>This example splits orthography and hyphenation, and adds syllabification because it
differs from hyphenation:<q rend="display">

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</egXML>
-->
    </p>
    <p>Multiple orthographic forms may be given, e.g. to illustrate a word's inflectional
    pattern:<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">brag</hi> ... vb. brags, bragging, bragged ... [CED]</q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

    </gramGrp>
    <form type="infl">
<orth>brags</orth>
<orth>bragging</orth>
<orth>bragged</orth>
    </form>
</egXML> Or the inflectional pattern may be indicated by reference to a table of
paradigms, as here:<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">horrifier</hi>
    <code lang="ipa">[ORifje]</code> (7) vt ... [C/R] </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <form>
<orth>horrifier</orth>
<pron>ORifje</pron>
<iType type="vbtable">7</iType>
    </form>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>As noted, <gi>iType</gi> etc. are synonymous with appropriately typed instances of
the general <gi>gram</gi> element; the last example might equally be tagged
    thus:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <form>
<orth>horrifier</orth>
<pron>ORifje</pron>
<gram type="iType / vbtable">7</gram>
    </form>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>Explanatory labels may be attached to alternate forms:<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">MTBF</hi>
    <hi rend="it">abbrev. for</hi> mean time between failures. [CED]</q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <entry>
<form type="abbrev">
    <orth>MTBF</orth>
</form>
<form type="full">
    <lbl>abbrev. for</lbl>
    <orth>mean time between failures</orth>
</form>
    </entry>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>When multiple orthographic forms are given, a pronunciation may be associated with
all of them, as here:<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">biryani</hi> or <hi rend="bold">biriani</hi>
    <code lang="ipa">(%bIrI"A:nI) </code> ... [CED]</q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <form>
<orth>biryani</orth>
<orth>biriani</orth>
<pron>%bIrI"A:nI</pron>
    </form>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>In other cases, different pronunciations are provided for different orthographic
forms; here, the <gi>form</gi> element is repeated to associate the first
orthographic form explicitly with the first pronunciation, and the second
orthographic form with the second pronunciation:<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">mackle</hi>
    <code lang="ipa">("m&amp;amp;k^@l) </code> or macule <code lang="ipa">("m&amp;amp;kju:l) </code> ... [CED] </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <form>
<orth>mackle</orth>
<pron>"m&amp;k&amp;supschwa;l</pron>
    </form>
    <form>
<orth>macule</orth>
<pron>"m&amp;kju:l</pron>
    </form>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>Recursive nesting of the <gi>form</gi> element can preserve relations among elements
that are implicit in the text. For example, in the CED entry for <q>hospitaller</q>,
it is clear that <q>U.S.</q> is associated only with <q>hospitaler</q>, but that the
pronunciation applies to both forms. The following encoding preserves these
    relations:<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">hospitaller</hi> or U.S. hospitaler <code lang="ipa">("hQspIt@l@) </code> ... [CED] </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

    <head>Grammatical Information</head>
    <p>The <gi>gramGrp</gi> element groups grammatical information, such as part of speech,
subcategorization information (e.g., syntactic patterns for verbs, count/mass
distinctions for nouns), etc. It can contain any of the following elements:<specList>
    <specDesc key="pos"/>
    <specDesc key="subc"/>
    <specDesc key="colloc"/>
</specList>
    </p>
    <p>In addition, <gi>gramGrp</gi> can contain any of the morphological elements defined
in section <ptr target="#DITPFO"/> for <gi>form</gi>:<specList>
    <specDesc key="gram"/>
    <specDesc key="iType"/>
    <specDesc key="gen"/>
    <specDesc key="number"/>
    <specDesc key="case"/>
    <specDesc key="per"/>
    <specDesc key="tns"/>
    <specDesc key="mood"/>
</specList> Elements conveying morphological information bear different
interpretations within <gi>gramGrp</gi> and <gi>form</gi> groups, the difference
being that in the <gi>form</gi> group, the morphological information specified
pertains to the specific alternate form in question, while within <gi>gramGrp</gi>
it applies to the headword form. For example, in the entry <q>
    <hi rend="bold">pinna</hi> ('pIn@) n., pl. -nae (-ni:) or -nas</q> [CED], the
word defined can be either singular or plural; the<q>pl.</q> specification applies
only to the inflected forms provided. Compare this with <q>pants (paents) pl.
n.</q>, where <q>pl.</q> applies to the headword itself. </p>
    <p>As noted above in section <ptr target="#DITPFO"/>, the elements for morphological
information are simply shorthand for the general purpose<gi>gram</gi> element.
Consider this entry for the French word<mentioned>médire</mentioned>:
<!-- no such word, unless you add the accent! (LB -->

    <p>Dictionaries may describe the meanings of words in a wide variety of different ways
— by means of synonyms, paraphrases, translations into other languages,
formal definitions in various highly stylized forms, etc. No attempt is made here to
distinguish all the different forms which sense information may take; all alike may
be tagged using the<gi>def</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#DITPDE"/>. </p>
    <p>Because as a special case it is frequently desired to distinguish the provision of
translation equivalents in other languages from other forms of sense information,
however, the specialized elements <gi>tr</gi> (translation equivalent) and
<gi>trans</gi> (which groups a translation equivalent with related information such
as its grammatical description) are defined for this purpose in section <ptr target="#DITPTR"/>. </p>
    <p>Whether sense information in multilingual dictionaries is consistently tagged using
<gi>tr</gi> or <gi>def</gi> is a matter of the encoder's choice; no blanket
recommendation is made here. </p>
    <div type="div4" xml:id="DITPDE">
<head>Definitions</head>
<p>Dictionary definitions are those pieces of prose in a dictionary entry that
    describe the meaning of some lexical item. Most often, definitions describe the
    headword of the entry; in some cases, they describe translated texts, examples,
    etc.; see <gi>tr</gi>, section<ptr target="#DITPTR"/>, and <gi>eg</gi>, section
<ptr target="#DITPEG"/>. The <gi>def</gi> element directly contains the text
    of the definition; unlike <gi>form</gi> and <gi>gramGrp</gi>, that is, it does
    not serve solely to group a set of smaller elements. The close analysis of
    definition text, such as the tagging of hypernyms, typical objects, etc., is not
    covered by these Guidelines. </p>
<p>Definitions may occur directly within an entry; when multiple definitions are
    given, they typically are identified as belonging to distinct senses, as here:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">demigod</hi> (...) n. 1.a. a being who is part mortal, part
god. b. a lesser deity. 2. a godlike person. [CP] </q>

<head>Translation Equivalents</head>
<p>Multilingual dictionaries contain information about translations of a given word
    in some source language for one or more target languages. Minimally, the
    dictionary provides the corresponding translation in the target language; other
    information, such as morphological information (gender, case), various kinds of
    usage restrictions, etc., may also be given. If translation equivalents are to
    be distinguished from other kinds of sense information, they may be encoded
    using the <gi>tr</gi> element. </p>
<p>As in monolingual dictionaries, the <gi>sense</gi> element is used in
    multilingual dictionaries to group information (forms, grammatical information,
    usage, translation(s), etc.) about a given sense of a word where necessary, as
    in monolingual dictionaries. Information about the individual translation
    equivalents within a sense is grouped using<gi>trans</gi> element. This
    information may include the translation text (tagged <gi>tr</gi> or
    <gi>def</gi>), morphological information (<gi>gen</gi>, <gi>case</gi>, etc.),
    usage notes (<gi>usg</gi>), translation labels (<gi>lbl</gi>), and definitions (<gi>def</gi>).<specList>
<specDesc key="trans"/>
<specDesc key="tr"/>
<specDesc key="lbl"/>
    </specList>
</p>
<p>Note how in the following example, different translation equivalents are grouped
    into the same or different senses, following the punctuation of the source and
    the usage labels:<q rend="display">

    <head>Etymological Information</head>
    <p>The element <gi>etym</gi> marks a block of etymological information. Etymologies may
contain highly structured lists of words in an order indicating their descent from
each other, but often also include related words and forms outside the direct line
of descent, for comparison. Not infrequently, etymologies include commentary of
various sorts, and can grow into short (or long!) essays with prose-like structure.
This variation in structure makes it impracticable to define tags which capture the
entire intellectual structure of the etymology or record the precise interrelation
of all the words mentioned. It is, however, feasible to mark some of the more
obvious phrase-level elements frequently found in etymologies, using tags defined in
the core tag set or elsewhere in this chapter. Of particular relevance for the
markup of etymologies are:<specList>
    <specDesc key="etym"/>
    <specDesc key="lang"/>
    <specDesc key="date"/>
    <specDesc key="mentioned"/>
    <specDesc key="gloss"/>
    <specDesc key="pron"/>
    <specDesc key="usg"/>
    <specDesc key="lbl"/>
</specList>
    </p>
    <p>As in other prose, individual word forms mentioned in an etymological description are
tagged with <gi>mentioned</gi> elements. Pronunciations, usage labels, and glosses
can be tagged using the<gi>pron</gi>, <gi>usg</gi>, and <gi>gloss</gi> elements
defined elsewhere in these Guidelines. In addition, the <gi>lang</gi> element may be
used to identify a particular language name where it appears, in addition to using
the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute of the<gi>mentioned</gi> element. </p>

<head>Usage Information and Other Labels</head>
<p>Most dictionaries provide restrictive labels and phrases indicating the usage of

    usage, may be attached to forms, translations, cross references, and examples.
    Usage and other labels should be marked with the following elements:<specList>
<specDesc key="usg"/>
<specDesc key="lbl"/>
    </specList> Typical usage labels mark<list type="bullets">
<item>temporal use (archaic, obsolete, etc.)</item>
<item>register (slang, formal, taboo, ironic, facetious, etc.)</item>
<item>style (literal, figurative, etc.)</item>
<item>connotative effect (e.g. derogatory, offensive)</item>
<item>subject field (Astronomy, Philosophy, etc.)</item>
<item>national or regional use (Australian, U.S., Midland dialect, etc.)</item>
    </list> Many dictionaries provide an explanation and/or a list of such usage
    labels in a preface or appendix. The type of the usage information may be
    indicated in the <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>usg</gi> element. Some

		<head>Cross References to Other Entries</head>
		<p>Dictionary entries frequently refer to information in other entries, often using
		extremely dense notations to convey the headword of the entry to be sought, the
		particular part of the entry being referred to, and the nature of the
		information to be sought there (synonyms, antonyms, usage notes, etymology, an
		illustration, etc.)</p>
		<p>Cross references may be tagged in dictionaries
		using the<gi>ref</gi> and <gi>ptr</gi> elements
		defined in the core tag set (section <ptr target="#COXR"/>). In addition, the <gi>xr</gi> element
		may be used to group all the information relating to a
		cross reference. The following elements may be used
		for tagging cross references within
dictionaries:<specList>
<specDesc key="xr"/>
<specDesc key="ref"/>
<specDesc key="ptr"/>
<specDesc key="ref"/>
<specDesc key="ptr"/>
<specDesc key="lbl"/>
    </specList>
</p>
<p>As in other types of text, the actual pointing element (e.g.<gi>ref</gi> or
    <gi>ptr</gi>) is used to tag the cross-reference target proper (in dictionaries,
    usually the headword, possibly accompanyied by a homograph number, a sense
    number, or other further restriction specifiying what portion of the target
    entry is being referred to); as usual, a <gi>ptr</gi> element may be used when
    the actual text of the target description can be reconstructed automatically,
    and a<gi>ref</gi> element is typically to be preferred when it cannot be
    reconstructed automatically.
    <!-- in P4, XR or refPhr should go into core. -msm --> The <gi>xr</gi> element
    is used to group the target with any accompanying phrases or symbols used to
    label the cross reference; the cross reference label itself may be tagged as a
    <gi>lbl</gi> or may remain untagged. Both of the following are thus
legitimate:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">glee</hi> ... Compare<hi rend="bold">madrigal</hi> (sense 1)
[CED] </q>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry>
    <form>
<orth>glee</orth>
    </form>
    <xr>Compare <ptr target="#madrigal.1"/>
    </xr>
</entry>
    </egXML>
    <q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">hostellerie</hi> Syn. de hôtellerie (sens 1). [DNT] </q>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<xr type="syn">
    <lbl>Syn. de</lbl>
    <ref>hôtellerie (sens 1)</ref>.</xr>
    </egXML> In addition to using, or not using, <gi>lbl</gi> to mark the
    cross-reference label, the two examples differ in another way. The former
    assumes that the first sense of <mentioned>madrigal</mentioned> has the
    identifier <q>madrigal.1</q>, and that the specific form of the reference in the
    source volume can be reconstructed, if needed, from that information. The latter
    does not require the first sense of<q>hôtellerie</q> to have an
    identifier, and retains the print form of the cross reference; by omitting the
    <att>target</att> attribute of the <gi>ref</gi> element, however, the second
    example does assume implicitly either that some software could usefully parse
    the phrase tagged as a <gi>ref</gi> and find the location referred to, or else
    that such processing will not be necessary. </p>
<p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the pointing element or on the<gi>xr</gi>
    element may be used to indicate what kind of cross reference is being made,
    using any convenient typology. Since different dictionaries may label the same
    kind of cross reference in different ways, it may be useful to give normalized
    indications in the<att>type</att> attribute, enabling the encoder to distinguish
    irregular forms of cross reference more reliably:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">rose</hi>2 ... vb. the past tense of <hi rend="bold">rise</hi>. [CED] </q>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry n="2" type="xr, hom">
    <form>
<orth>rose</orth>
    </form>
    <xr type="pastof">
<lbl>the past tense of</lbl>
<ref target="#rise">rise</ref>
    </xr>
</entry>
    </egXML> from cross-references for synonyms and the like:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">antagonist</hi> ... syn see<hi rend="bold">adverse</hi> [W7] </q>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<xr type="syn">
    <lbl>syn see</lbl>
    <ref target="#adverse">adverse</ref>
</xr>
    </egXML> Strictly speaking, the reference above is not to the entry
    for<mentioned>adverse</mentioned>, but to the list of synonyms found at that
    entry. Slightly more complicated is the following reference to an illustration
    accompanying another entry:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">ax, axe</hi> ... → see the illus at <hi rend="bold">tool</hi> [OALD] </q> This entry refers to the illustration at
    the entry for<mentioned>tool</mentioned>, not the entry itself. The
    <att>target</att> attribute might give the identifier of the illustration
    itself, or of the enclosing entry (in which case the <att>type</att> attribute
    might be used to infer that the reference is actually to the illustration, not
    the entry as a whole).<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<xr type="see illustration">
    <lbl>see the illus at</lbl>
    <ptr target="#tool.illus"/>
</xr>
    </egXML> In some cases, the cross reference is to a particular subset of the
    meanings of the entry in question:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">globe</hi> ...V. <hi rend="bold">armillaire</hi>
(sphère) [PR] </q>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<xr>V. <ref target="#armillaire">armillaire</ref>
    <lbl type="sense-restriction">sphère</lbl>
</xr>
    </egXML>
</p>
<p>Cross-references occasionally occur in definition texts, example texts, etc., or
    may be free-standing within an entry. These may typically be encoded using
    <gi>ref</gi> or <gi>ptr</gi>, without an enclosing <gi>xr</gi>. For example:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">entacher</hi> ... <hi rend="it">Acte entaché de
nullité,</hi> contenant un vice de forme ou passé par un incapable*. [DNT]
    </q> The asterisk signals a reference to the entry
for<mentioned>incapable</mentioned>.<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<def>contenant un vice de forme ou passé par un <ptr target="#incapable"/>.</def>
    </egXML>
    <!-- surely this should have been tagged as a <ref> not a 
<ptr> LB ? --> In
    some cases, the form in the definition is inflected, and thus<gi>ref</gi> must
    be used, as here:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">justifier</hi> ...4. IMPRIM Donner a (une ligne) une longeur
convenable au moyen de blancs (2, sens 1, 3). [DNT] </q>

<head>Headword and Pronunciation References</head>
<p>Examples, definitions, etymologies, and occasionally other elements such as cross
    references, orthographic forms, etc., often contain a shortened or iconic reference to
    the headword, rather than repeating the headword itself. The references may be to the
    orthographic form or to the pronunciation, to the form given or to a variant of that
    form. The following elements are used to encode such iconic references to a headword:<specList>
<specDesc key="oRef" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="pRef"/>
<specDesc key="oVar" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="pVar"/>
    </specList>
</p>
<p>As members of the class <ident type="class">att.ptrLike.form</ident>, all these elements
    share a <att>target</att> attribute, which may optionally be used to resolve any
    ambiguity about the headword form being referred to.<specList>
<specDesc key="att.ptrLike.form" atts="target"/>
    </specList>
</p>
<p>Headword references come in a variety of formats:<list type="gloss">
<label>~ </label>
<item>indicates a reference to the full form of the headword</item>
<label>pref~ </label>
<item>gives a prefix to be affixed to the headword</item>
<label>~suf </label>
<item>gives a suffix to be affixed to the headword</item>
<label>A~ </label>
<item>gives the first letter in upper case, indicating that the headword is capitalized</item>
<label>pref~suf </label>
<item>gives a prefix and a suffix to be affixed to the headword</item>
<label>a. </label>
<item>gives the initial of the word followed by a full stop, to indicate reference
    to the full form of the headword</item>
<label>A. </label>
<item>refers to a capitalized form of the headword </item>
    </list>
</p>
<p>The <gi>oRef</gi> element should be used for iconic or shortened references to the
    orthographic form(s) of the headword itself. It is an empty element and replaces, rather
    than enclosing, the reference. Note that the reference to a headword is not necessarily
    a simple string replacement. In the example <q>
<hi rend="bold">colour</hi>1, (US = color) ...~ films; ~ TV; Red, blue and yellow
are ~s.</q> [OALD], the tilde stands for either headword form
    (<mentioned>colour</mentioned>, <mentioned>color</mentioned>). </p>

<p>In many cases the reference is not to the orthographic form of the headword, but rather
    to another form of the headword — usually to an inflected form. In these
    cases, the element <gi>oVar</gi> should be used; this element takes as its content the
    string as it appears in the text.<q rend="display">

<p>In addition, some dictionaries make reference to the pronunciation of the headword in the

<head>Typographic and Lexical Information in Dictionary Data</head>
<p>Among the many possible views of dictionaries, it is useful to distinguish at least the
    following three, which help to clarify some issues raised with particular urgency by
    dictionaries, on account of the complexity of both their typography and their
    information structure.<list type="bullets">
<item>(a) the <term>typographic view</term>, which is concerned with the
    two-dimensional printed page, including information about line and page breaks
    and other features of layout </item>
<item>(b) the <term>editorial view</term> — the one-dimensional sequence
    of tokens which can be seen as the input to the typesetting process; the wording
    and punctuation of the text and the sequencing of items are visible in this
    view, but specifics of the typographic realization are not </item>
<item>(c) the <term>lexical view</term> — this view includes the
    underlying information represented in a dictionary, without concern for its
    exact textual form </item>
    </list>
</p>
<p>For example, a domain indication in a dictionary entry might be broken over a line and
    therefore hyphenated (<q>naut-</q>
    <q>ical</q>); the typographic view of the dictionary preserves this information. In a
    purely editorial view, the particular form in which the domain name is given in the
    particular dictionary (as <q>nautical</q>, rather than<q>naut.</q>, <q>Naut.</q>, etc.)
    would be preserved, but the fact of the line break would not. Font shifts might
    plausibly be included in either a strictly typographic or an editorial view. In the
    lexical view, the only information preserved concerning domain would be some standard
    symbol or string representing the nautical domain (e.g.<q>naut.</q>) regardless of the
    form in which it appears in the printed dictionary. </p>
<p>In practice, publishers begin with the lexical view — i.e., lexical data as it
    might appear in a database — and generate first the editorial view, which
    reflects editorial choices for a particular dictionary (such as the use of the
    abbreviation <q>Naut.</q> for<q>nautical</q>, the fonts in which different types of
    information are to be rendered, etc.), and then the typographic view, which is tied to a
    specific printed rendering. Computational linguists and philologists often begin with
    the typographic view and analyse it to obtain the editorial and/or lexical views. Some
    users may ultimately be concerned with retaining only the lexical view, or they may wish
    to preserve the typographic or editorial views as a reference text, perhaps as a guard
    against the loss or misinterpretation of information in the translation process. Some
    researchers may wish to retain all three views, and study their interrelations, since
    research questions may well span all three views. </p>
<p>In general, an electronic encoding of a text will allow the recovery of at least one view
    of that text (the one which guided the encoding); if editorial and typographic practices
    are consistently applied in the production of a printed dictionary, or if exceptions to
    the rules are consistently recorded in the electronic encoding, then it is <emph>in
    principle</emph> possible to recover the editorial view from an encoding of the lexical
    view, and the typographic view from an encoding of the editorial view. In practice, of
    course, the severe compression of information in dictionaries, the variety of methods by
    which this compression is achieved, the complexity of formulating completely explicit
    rules for editorial and typographic practice, and the relative rarity of complete
    consistency in the application of such rules, all make the mechanical transformation of
    information from one view into another something of a vexed question. </p>
<p>This section describes some principles which may be useful in capturing one or the other
    of these views as consistently and completely as possible, and describes some methods of
    attempting to capture more than one view in a single encoding. Only the editorial and
    lexical views are explicitly treated here; for methods of recording the physical or
    typographic details of a text, see chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>. Other approaches to these
    problems, such as the use of repetitive encoding and links to show their
    correspondences, or the use of feature structures to capture the information structure,
    and of the <att>ana</att> and<att>inst</att> attributes to link feature structures to a
    transcription of the editorial view of a dictionary, are not discussed here. (For
    feature structures, see chapter <ptr target="#FS"/>. For linkage of textual form and
    underlying information, see chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>.) </p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DIMVTV">
    <head>Editorial View</head>
    <p>Common practice in encoding texts of all sorts relies on principles such as the
following, which can be used successfully to capture the editorial view when
encoding a dictionary:<list type="ordered">
    <item>All characters of the source text should be retained, with the possible
exception of <term>rendition text</term> (for which see further below). </item>
    <item>Characters appearing in the source text should typically be given as
character data content in the document, rather than as the value of an
attribute; again, rendition text may optionally be excepted from this rule. </item>
    <item>Apart from the characters or graphics in the source text, nothing else
should appear as content in the document, although it may be given in
attribute values. </item>
    <item>The material in the source text should appear in the encoding in the same
order. Complications of the character sequence by footnotes, marginal notes,
etc., text wrapping around illustrations, etc., may be dealt with by the
usual means (for notes, see section <ptr target="#CONO"/>).<note place="foot">Complications of sequence caused by marginal or interlinear
    insertions and deletions, which are frequent in manuscripts, or by
    unconventional page layouts, as in concrete poetry, magazines with
    imaginative graphic designers, and texts about the nature of typography
    as a medium, typically do not occur in dictionaries, and so are not
    discussed here.</note>
    </item>
</list>
    </p>
    <p>In a very conservative transcription of the editorial view of a text, <term>rendition
characters</term> (e.g. the commas, parentheses, etc., used in dictionary entries to
signal boundaries among parts of the entry) and <term>rendition text</term> (for
example, conjunctions joining alternate headwords, etc.) are typically retained.
Removing the tags from such a transcription will leave all and only the characters
of the source text, in their original sequence.<note place="foot">This is a slight
    oversimplification. Even in conservative transcriptions, it is common to omit
    page numbers, signatures of gatherings, running titles and the like. The simple
    description above also elides, for the sake of simplicity, the difficulties of
    assigning a meaning to the phrase <q>original sequence</q> when it is applied to
    the printed characters of a source text; the <q>original sequence</q> retained
    or recovered from a conservative transcription of the editorial view is, of
    course, the one established during the transcription by the encoder.</note>
    </p>
    <p>Consider, for example, the following entry:<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">pinna</hi> ('pIn@) n., pl. -nae (-ni:) <hi rend="it">or</hi>
    -nas. 1. any leaflet of a pinnate compound leaf. 2. <hi rend="it">Zoology</hi>.
    a feather, wing, fin, or similarly shaped part. 3. another name for <hi rend="bold">auricle</hi> (sense 2). [C18: via New Latin from Latin: wing,
    feather, fin] [CED]</q> A conservative encoding of the editorial view of this
entry, which retains all rendition text, might resemble the following:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

    </entry>
</egXML>
    </p>
    <p>A somewhat simplified encoding of the editorial view of this entry might exploit the
fact that rendition text is often systematically recoverable. For example,
parentheses consistently appear around pronunciation in this dictionary, and thus
are effectively implied by the start- and end-tags for <gi>pron</gi>.<note place="foot">The omission of rendition text is particularly common in systems
    for document production; it is considered good practice there, since automatic
    generation of rendition text is more reliable and more consistent than
    attempting to maintain it manually in the electronic text.</note> In such an
encoding, removing the tags should exactly reproduce the sequence of characters in
the source, minus rendition text. The original character sequence can be recovered
fully by replacing tags with any rendition text they imply. </p>
    <p>Encoding in this way, the example given above might resemble the following. The
<gi>tagUsage</gi> element in the header would be used to record the following
patterns of rendition text:<list type="bullets">
    <item>parentheses appear around <gi>pron</gi> elements</item>
    <item>commas appear before inflected forms</item>
    <item>the word <q>or</q> appears before alternate forms</item>
    <item>brackets appear around the etymology</item>
    <item>full stops appear after <gi>pos</gi>, inflection information, and sense numbers</item>
    <item>senses are numbered in sequence unless otherwise specified using the
global <att>n</att> attribute</item>

    <p>When rendition text is omitted, it is recommended that the means to regenerate it be
fully documented, using the <gi>tagUsage</gi> element of the TEI header. </p>
    <p>If rendition text is used systematically in a dictionary, with only a few mistakes or
exceptions, the global attribute <att>rend</att> may be used on any tag to flag
exceptions to the normal treatment. The values of the <att>rend</att> attribute are
not prescribed, but it can be used with values such as <val>no-comma</val>, <val>no-left-paren</val>, etc. Specific
values can be documented using the <gi>rendition</gi> element in the TEI header. </p>
    <p>In the following (imaginary) example, no left parenthesis precedes the

    <head>Lexical View</head>
    <p>If the text to be interchanged retains only the lexical view of the text, there may
be no concern for the recoverability of the editorial (not to speak of the
typographic) view of the text. However, it is strongly recommended that the TEI
header be used to document fully the nature of all alterations to the original data,
such as normalization of domain names, expansion of inflected forms, etc. </p>
    <p>In an encoding of the lexical view of a text, there are degrees of departure from the
original data: normalizing inconsistent forms like<q>nautical</q>, <q>naut</q>.,
<q>Naut.</q>, etc., to <q>nautical</q> is a relatively slight alteration; expansion
of <q>delay -ed -ing</q> to<q>delay, delayed, delaying</q> is a more substantial
departure. Still more severe is the rearranging of the order of information in
entries — for example,<list type="bullets">
    <item>reorganizing the order of elements in an entry to show their relationship,
as in<q rend="display">
    <hi rend="bold">clem</hi> (klEm) or clam vb. clems, clemming, clemmed or
    clams, clamming, clammed [CED]</q> where in a strictly lexical view one

inflected forms. </item>
    <item>splitting an entry into two separate entries, as in<q rend="display">

</list>
    </p>
    <p>An encoding which captures the lexical view of the example given in the previous

    <head>Retaining Both Views</head>
    <p>It is sometimes desirable to retain both the lexical and the editorial view, in which
case a potential conflict exists between the two. When there is a conflict between
the encodings for the lexical and editorial views, the principles described in the
following sections may be applied. </p>
    <div type="div4" xml:id="DIMVAV">
<head>Using Attribute Values to Capture Alternate Views</head>
<p>If the order of the data is the same in both views, then both views may be
    captured by encoding one <soCalled>dominant</soCalled> view in the character
    data content of the document, and encoding the other using attribute values on
    the appropriate elements. If all tags were to be removed, the remaining
    characters would be those of the dominant view of the text. </p>
<p>The attribute class <ident type="class">att.lexicographic</ident> is used to provide
    attributes for use in encoding multiple views of the same dictionary entry.
    These attributes are available for use on all elements defined in this chapter
    when the base tag set for dictionaries is selected. </p>
<p>When the editorial view is dominant, the following attributes may be used to
    capture the lexical view:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.lexicographic" atts="norm split"/>
    </specList>
</p>
<p>When the lexical view is dominant, the following attributes may be used to record
    the editorial view:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.lexicographic" atts="orig mergedin"/>
    </specList>
</p>
<p>One attribute is useful in either view:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.lexicographic" atts="opt"/>
    </specList>
</p>
<p>For example, if the source text had the domain label <q>naut.</q>, it might be
    encoded as follows. With the editorial view dominant:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<usg norm="nautical" type="dom">naut.</usg>
    </egXML> The lexical view of the same label would transcribe the normalized form
    as content of the <gi>usg</gi> element, the typographic form as an attribute
value:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<usg orig="naut." type="dom">nautical</usg>
    </egXML>
</p>
<p>If the source text gives inflectional information for the
    verb<mentioned>delay</mentioned> as <q>delay, -ed, -ing</q>, it might usefully
    be expanded to <q>delayed, delayed, delaying</q>. An encoding of the editorial
    view might take this form:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
    <orth>delay</orth>
    <form type="infl">
<orth norm="delayed" extent="part">-ed</orth>
<tns norm="pst,pstp"/>
    </form>
    <form type="infl">
<orth norm="delaying" extent="part">-ing</orth>
<tns norm="prsp"/>
    </form>
</form>
    </egXML> Note the use of the <gi>tns</gi> tag with null content, to enable the
    representation of implicit information even though it has no print realization. </p>
<p>The lexical view might be encoded thus:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
    <orth>delay</orth>
    <form type="infl">
<orth orig="-ed">delayed</orth>
<tns orig="">pst</tns>
<tns orig="">pstp</tns>
    </form>
    <form type="infl">
<orth orig="-ing">delaying</orth>
<tns orig="">prsp</tns>
    </form>
</form>
    </egXML>
</p>
<p>A particular problem may be posed by the common practice of presenting two
    alternate forms of a word in a single string, by marking some parts of the word
    as optional in some forms. The following entry is for a word which can be
    spelled either <q>thyrostimuline</q> or<q>thyréostimuline</q>:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">thyr(é)ostimuline</hi> [tiR(e)ostimylin] ...</q> With the
    editorial view dominant, this entry might begin thus:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
    <orth split="thyrostimuline, thyréostimuline">thyr(é)ostimuline</orth>

</form>
    </egXML> With the lexical view dominant, however, two <gi>orth</gi> and
    two<gi>pron</gi> elements would be encoded, in order to disentangle the two
    forms; the <att>orig</att> attribute would be used to record the typographic
    presentation of the information in the source.<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

    <orth xml:id="dic-o1" orig="thyr(é)ostimuline">thyrostimuline</orth>

<p>This example might also be encoded using the <att>opt</att> attribute combined
    with the attributes <att>next</att> and<att>prev</att> defined in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>.<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>

<p>Note that this transcription preserves both the lexical and editorial views in a
    single encoding. However, it has the disadvantage that the strings corresponding
    to entire words do not appear in the encoding uninterrupted, and therefore
    complex processing is required to retrieve them from the encoded text. The use
    of the <att>opt</att> attribute is recommended, however, when long spans of text
    are involved, or when the optional part contains embedded tags. </p>
<p>For example, the following gives two definitions in one text:<q>picture drawn
with coloured chalk made into crayons</q>, and<q>coloured chalk made into
crayons</q>:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">pas.tel</hi> /"p&amp;amp;stl US: p&amp;amp;"stel/ n
1 (picture drawn with) coloured chalk made into crayons. 2... [OALD]</q>
</p>
<p>A simple encoding solution would be to leave the definition text unanalysed, but
    this might be felt inadequate since it does not show that there are two
    definitions. A possible alternative encoding would be:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<sense n="1">
    <def>coloured chalk made into crayons</def>
    <def>picture drawn with coloured chalk made into crayons</def>
</sense>
    </egXML>
</p>
<p>This transcribes some characters of the source text twice, however, which
    deviates from the usual practice. The following encoding records both the
    editorial and lexical views:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<sense n="1">
    <def next="#d2" xml:id="d1" opt="true">picture drawn with</def>
    <def prev="#d1" xml:id="d2">coloured chalk made into crayons</def>
</sense>
    </egXML>
</p>
<p>A more complex example is the following, in which the optional element contains
    additional tags:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">canary</hi> ...(Geog) Canary Isles, Canaries (îles
fpl) Canaries fpl... [C/R]</q>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<re type="cmpd">
    <usg type="dom">Geog</usg>
    <form>
<orth>Canary Isles</orth>
<orth>Canaries</orth>
    </form>
    <trans next="#DICT-t2" xml:id="DICT-t1" opt="true">

<head>Recording Original Locations of Transposed Elements</head>
<p>The attributes described in the previous section are useful only when the order
    of material is the same in both the editorial and the lexical view. When the two
    views impose different orders on the data, the ID/IDREF mechanism may be used to
    show the original location of material transposed in an encoding of the lexical
    view. </p>
<p>If the original is only slightly modified, the <gi>anchor</gi> element may be
    used to mark the original location of the material, and the <att>location</att>
    attribute may be used on the lexical encoding of that material to indicate its
    original location(s). Like those in the preceding section, this attribute is
    defined for the attribute class<ident type="class">att.lexicographic</ident>:<specList>

    <head>Attributes for Dictionary Elements</head>
    <p>The attributes provided for all dictionary-specific elements and documented in this
section are defined thus:<specGrp xml:id="DEDIMV" n="Attributes for dictionary work">

<head>Unstructured Entries</head>
<p>The content model for the <gi>entry</gi> element provides an entry structure suitable for
    many average dictionaries, as well as many regular entries in more exotic dictionaries.
    However, the structure of some dictionaries does not allow the restrictions imposed by
    the content model for <gi>entry</gi>. To handle these cases, the <gi>entryFree</gi> and
    <gi>dictScrap</gi> elements are provided to support much wider variation in entry
    structure. The <gi>dictScrap</gi> element offers less freedom, in that it can only
    contain phrase level elements, but it can itself appear at any point within a dictionary
    entry where any of the structural components of a dictionary entry are permitted. As
    such, it acts as a container for otherwise anomalous parts of an entry.</p>
<p>The <gi>entryFree</gi> element places no constraints at all upon the entry: any element
    defined in this chapter, as well as all the phrase-level and inter-level elements
    defined in the core tag set, can appear anywhere within it. With the <gi>entryFree</gi>
    element, the encoder is free to use any element anywhere, as well as to use or omit
    grouping elements such as <gi>form</gi>, <gi>gramGrp</gi>, etc. </p>
<p>The <gi>entryFree</gi> element allows the encoding of entries which violate the structure
    specified for the <gi>entry</gi> element. For example, in the following entry from a
    dictionary already in electronic form, it is necessary to include a<gi>pron</gi> element
    within a <gi>def</gi>. This is not permitted in the content model for <gi>entry</gi>,
    but it poses no problem in the<gi>entryFree</gi> element.

<p>The <gi>entryFree</gi> element also makes it possible to transcribe a dictionary using
    only phrase-level (<soCalled>atomic</soCalled>) elements—that is, using no
    grouping elements at all. This can be desirable if the encoder wants a completely
    <soCalled>flat</soCalled> view, with no indication of or commitment to the association
    of one element with another. The following encoding uses no grouping elements, and keeps
    all rendition text:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">biryani</hi> or <hi rend="bold">biriani</hi>
<code lang="ipa">(%bIrI"A:nI) </code> any of a variety of Indian dishes...[from
