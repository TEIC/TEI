<head>Places</head>
<p>In <ptr target="#NDPLAC"/> we discuss various ways of naming places such as towns,
  countries etc. In much the same way as these guidelines distinguish between the encoding
  of names for people and the encoding of other data about people, so they also
  distinguish between the encoding of names for places and the encoding of other data
  about places. In this section we present elements which may be used to record in a
  structured way data about places of any kind which might be named or referenced within a
  text. Such data may be useful as a way of normalising or standardizing references to
  particular places, as the raw material for a gazeteer or similar reference document
  associated with a particular text or set of texts, or in conjunction with any form of
  geographical information system.</p>
<p>The following elements are provided for this purpose: <specList>
    <specDesc key="listPlace"/>
    <specDesc key="place"/>
  </specList>
</p>
<p>A <gi>place</gi> element will usually contain at least one, and possibly several,
    <gi>placeName</gi>-like elements indicating the names associated with it, by different
  people, in different languages, or at different times. A place is defined, however, by
  its physical location. Locations may be specified in a number of ways: as a set of
  co-ordinates defining a point or an area on the surface of the earth, or by providing a
  description of how the place may be found, usually in terms of other placeNames. For
  example, we can identify the location of the Canadian city of London, either by
  specifying its latitute and longitude, or by specifying that we mean the city called
  London located in the province called Ontario within the country called Canada. </p>
<p>In addition we may wish to supply a brief characterization of the place identified, for
  example to state that it is a city, an administrative area such as a country, or a
  landmark of some kind such as a monument or a battlefield. If our typology of places is
  simple, the open ended <att>type</att> attribute is the easiest way to represent it: so
  we might say <tag>place type="city"</tag>, <gi>place type="battlefield"</gi> etc. </p>
<p>Within the <gi>place</gi> element, the following elements may be used to provide more
  information about specific aspects of the place in a structured form: <specList>
    <specDesc key="placeName"/>
    <specDesc key="location"/>
    <specDesc key="listPlace"/>
    <specDesc key="place"/>
  </specList>
</p>
<p> For example, the modern city of Lyon in France was in Roman times known as Lugdunum.
  Although the modern and the Roman city are not physically co-extensive, they have
  significant areas which overlap, and we may therefore wish to regard them as the same
  place, while supplying both names with an indication of the time period during which
  each was current. </p>
<p>The simplest method of specifying a location is by means of its geographic
  co-ordinates. There are a number of different schemes available for specifying the
  reference frame for the co-ordinate system, as also for the representation of latitude
  and longitude. The default recommended by these Guidelines is to supply a string
  containing two real numbers according to the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84) system;
  this is the system currently used by most GPS applications which TEI users are likely to
  encounter. <note place="foot">The most recent revision of this standard is known as the
    Earth Gravity Model 1996.</note>We might therefore record the information about the
  place known as <soCalled>Lyon</soCalled> as follows: <egXML
    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <place xml:id="LYON1" type="city">
      <placeName notBefore="1400">Lyon</placeName>
      <placeName notAfter="0056">Lugdunum</placeName>
      <location scheme="latlong">41.687142 -74.870109</location>
    </place>
  </egXML>
</p>
<div>
  <head>Varieties of location</head>
  <p>In the following example, we have defined the place <soCalled>Lyon</soCalled> in
    terms of its geographical co-ordinates specified using the Geographical Markup
    Language being defined by the OGC<note place="foot">The OGC is an international
      voluntary consensus standards organization whose members maintain the Geography
      Markup Language standard. The OGC coordinates with the ISO TC 211 standards
      organization to maintain consistency between OGC and ISO standards work. GML is in
      the process of being adopted as an ISO standard (ISO 19136) and is expected to be
      released as an International Standard in 2007.</note> and indicated the two names
    associated with it at different times: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place type="city">
        <placeName notBefore="1400">Lyon</placeName>
        <placeName notAfter="0056">Lugdunum</placeName>
        <location>
<gml:Polygon>
  <gml:exterior>
    <gml:LinearRing> 45.256 -110.45 46.46 -109.48 43.84 -109.86 45.8 -109.2
      45.256 -110.45 </gml:LinearRing>
  </gml:exterior>
</gml:Polygon>
        </location>
      </place>
    </egXML>
  </p>
  <p>Alternatively, or in addition, we might identify Lyon by its geo-political status as
    a settlement within a country forming part of a larger political entity, independent
    of its geographic location: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place xml:id="LYON2">
        <placeName notBefore="1400">Lyon</placeName>
        <placeName notAfter="0056">Lugdunum</placeName>
        <location>
        <bloc>EU</bloc>
          <country>France</country>
        </location>
      </place>
    </egXML> The elements <gi>bloc</gi> etc. are specialised forms of <gi>placeName</gi>,
    as discussed in <ptr target="NDPLGU"/>. </p>
  <p>The <att>type</att> attribute is available to categorize more precisely both the kind
    of place concerned, and the kind of name used to locate it. For example, a single
    building or a street may both be regarded as a kind of place, just as a part of a
      <gi>location</gi> called a <soCalled>district</soCalled> may also be more precisely
    specified as an <soCalled>arrondissement</soCalled> as in this example: <egXML
      xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place type="building">
        <placeName>Brasserie Georges</placeName>
        <location>
<country key="FR"/>
<settlement type="city">Lyon</settlement>
<district type="arrondissement">Perrache</district>
<placeName type="street">Rue de la Charité</placeName>
        </location>
      </place>
    </egXML>
  </p>
  <p>Over time, a place may change its name but not its location, or its location and not
    its name, or both. These possibilities are all catered for in the same way, by
    supplying multiple <gi>placeName</gi> or <gi>location</gi> elements along with
    attributes taken from the att.dating class. For example, we may indicate the differing
    physical locations of Roman and modern Lyon as follows: <egXML
      xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place xml:id="LYON3">
        <placeName notBefore="1400">Lyon</placeName>
        <placeName notAfter="-0056">Lugdunum</placeName>
        <location notAfter="-0056">
<gml:Polygon>
  <gml:exterior>
    <gml:LinearRing> 45.1 -110.23 46.48 -99.08 31.74 -108.86 45.3 -78.2 42.25
      -103.45 </gml:LinearRing>
  </gml:exterior>
</gml:Polygon>
        </location>
        <location notBefore="1950">
<gml:Polygon>
  <gml:exterior>
    <gml:LinearRing> 45.256 -110.45 46.46 -109.48 43.84 -109.86 45.8 -109.2
      45.256 -110.45 </gml:LinearRing>
  </gml:exterior>
</gml:Polygon>
        </location>
      </place>
    </egXML></p>
  <p>We may know very little about a place: for example, we may know its location and the
    type of object found there, but have no name for it: <egXML
      xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place xml:id="HARRYS" type="fireHydrant">
        <location>Junction of Park Street and Charlotte Street</location>
      </place>
    </egXML>
  </p>
  <p>We may even wish to treat imaginary places in the same way: <egXML
      xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place>
        <placeName>Atlantis</placeName>
        <location>
<offset>beyond</offset>
<placeName>The Pillars of <persName>Hercules</persName></placeName>
        </location>
      </place>
    </egXML></p>
  <p>The <gi>location</gi> element may thus identify a place to a greater or lesser degree
    of precision, using a variety of means: a name, a set of names, or a set of
    co-ordinates. A <gi>location</gi> sometimes resemble a set of instructions for finding
    a place, rather than a name: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place xml:id="MYF">
        <placeName notAfter="1969">Yasgur's Farm</placeName>
        <placeName notBefore="1969">Woodstock Festival Site</placeName>
        <location>
<measure>one mile</measure>
<offset>north west of</offset>
<settlement>Bethel</settlement>
<region>New York</region>
        </location>
      </place>
    </egXML>
    <!-- or why not have explicit <lat> and <long> elements? -->
  </p>
  <p>The element <gi>address</gi> may also be used to identify a location in terms of its
    postal or other address: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place type="cemetery">
        <placeName>Protestant Cemetery</placeName>
        <placeName type="official" xml:lang="it">Cimitero Acattolico</placeName>
        <location type="geopolitical">
<country>Italy</country>
<settlement>Rome</settlement>
<district>Testaccio</district>
        </location>
        <location type="address">
<address><addrLine>Via Caio Cestio, 6</addrLine><addrLine>00153 Roma</addrLine></address>
        </location>
      </place>
    </egXML> When, as here, the same place is given multiple locations, the
    <att>type</att> attribute should be used to characterize the kind of location, as a
    means of indicating that these are alternative ways of identifying the same place,
    rather than that place is spread across several locations. </p>
  <p>If the string within a <gi>location</gi> element uses some other geodetic system, the
      <att>scheme</att> attribute should indicate this by taking the value
    <val>other</val>.</p>
  <p>A <gi>bibl</gi> element may be used within <gi>location</gi> to indicate the source
    of the location information.</p>
  <!-- example needed -->
</div>
<div>
  <head>Multiple places</head>
  <p>A place may contain other places. This containment relation can be directly modelled
    in XML: thus we can say that the towns of Vilnius and Kaunas are both in a place
    called Lithuania (or Lietuva) as follows: <egXML
      xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place>
        <country>Lithuania</country>
        <country xml:lang="lt">Lietuva</country>
        <place>
<settlement>Vilnius</settlement>
        </place>
        <place>
<settlement>Kaunas</settlement>
        </place>
      </place>
    </egXML>
  </p>
  <p>This does not, of course, imply that Vilnius and Kaunas are the only places
    constituting Lithuania; only that they are within it. A separate <gi>place</gi>
    element may indicate that it is a part of Lithuania by supplying a <gi>relation</gi>
    element, as discussed below (<ptr target="#place-rel"/>).</p>
  <p>As a further example, the islands of Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues are
    collectively known as the Mascarene Islands. Grouped together with Mauritius there are
    also several smaller offshore islands, with rather picturesque French names. One way
    of representing this is as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place type="islandGroup">
        <placeName>Mascarene Islands</placeName>
        <placeName>Mascarenhas Archipelago</placeName>
        <place type="island">
<placeName>Mauritius</placeName>
<listPlace type="offshoreIslands">
  <place>
    <placeName>La roche qui pleure</placeName>
  </place>
  <place>
    <placeName>Ile aux cerfs</placeName>
  </place>
</listPlace>
        </place>
        <place type="island">
<placeName>Rodrigues</placeName>
        </place>
        <place type="island">
<placeName>Réunion</placeName>
        </place>
      </place>
    </egXML>
  </p>
  <p>Here is a more complex example, showing the variety of names
  associated at different times and in different languages with a set
  of hierarchically grouped places — the settlement of Camarthen
  Castle, within the town of Carmarthen, within the administrative
  county of Carmarthenshire, Wales. <egXML
  xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place xml:id="wales" type="country">
        <placeName xml:lang="cy">Cymru</placeName>
        <placeName xml:lang="en">Wales</placeName>
        <placeName xml:lang="la">Wallie</placeName>
        <placeName xml:lang="la">Wallia</placeName>
        <placeName xml:lang="fro">Le Waleis</placeName>
        <place xml:id="carmarthenshire" type="region">
<region type="county" xml:lang="en" notBefore="1284">Carmarthenshire</region>
<place xml:id="carmarthen" type="settlement">
  <placeName xml:lang="en">Carmarthen</placeName>
  <placeName xml:lang="la" notBefore="1090" notAfter="1300">Kaermerdin</placeName>
  <placeName xml:lang="cy">Caerfyrddin</placeName>
  <place xml:id="carmarthen_castle" type="castle">
    <settlement>castle of Carmarthen</settlement>
  </place>
</place>
        </place>
      </place>
    </egXML>
  </p>
  <p>As noted previously, <gi>country</gi>, <gi>region</gi>, <gi>settlement</gi> are all
    specializations of the generic <gi>placename</gi> element; they are not
    specializations of the <gi>place</gi> element. If it is desired to distinguish amongst
    kinds of <emph>place</emph> this can only be done by means of the <att>type</att>
    attribute as in the above example.
    <!-- The use of values for the type attribute which correspond to
the names of a naming element ("country", "region", "settlement") is
recommended when appropriate but not required. (removed this sentence
as it is pretty incomprehensible) --></p>
  <p>This use of multiple <gi>place</gi> elements should be distinguished from the
    (possibly simpler) case where a number of places with some property in common are
    being grouped together for convenience, for example, in a gazeteer. The
    <gi>listPlace</gi> element is provided as a means of grouping places together where
    there is no implication that the grouped elements constitute a distinct place. For
    example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place type="county">
        <placeName>Herefordshire</placeName>
        <listPlace type="villages">
<place>
  <placeName>Abbey Dore</placeName>
  <location>51.969604 -2.893146</location>
</place>
<place>
  <placeName>Acton Beauchamp</placeName>
</place>
<!-- etc -->
        </listPlace>
        <listPlace type="towns">
<place>
  <placeName>Hereford</placeName>
</place>
<place>
  <placeName>Leominster</placeName>
</place>
<!-- etc  -->
        </listPlace>
      </place>
    </egXML>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <head>States, traits, and events</head>
  <p>There are many different kinds of information which it might be considered useful to
    record for a place in addition to its name and location, and the categories selected
    are likely to be very project-specific. As with persons therefore these Guidelines
    make no claim to comprehensiveness in this context. Instead, the generic
    <gi>state</gi>, <gi>trait</gi>, and <gi>event</gi> elements defined by this module
    should be used. Each of these may be customized for particular needs by means of their
      <att>type</att> attribute. These are complemented by a small number of predefined
    elements of general utility: <specList>
      <specDesc key="population"/>
      <specDesc key="climate"/>
      <specDesc key="terrain"/>
    </specList>
  </p>
  <p>The first of these is a specialization of the generic <gi>state</gi> element; while
    the second two are specializations of the generic <gi>trait</gi> element. The generic
      <gi>event</gi> element may be used for almost any kind of event in the life of a
    place; no specialized version of this element is proposed, nor do we attempt to
    enumerate the possible values which might be appropriate for the <att>type</att>
    attribute on any of these generic elements. </p>
  <p>Here is an example, showing how the specific and generic elements may be combined:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place xml:id="IS">
        <placeName xml:lang="en">Iceland</placeName>
        <placeName xml:lang="is">Ísland</placeName>
        <location type="other">65 00 N, 18 00 W</location>
        <terrain>
<label>area</label>
<p>103,000 sq km</p>
        </terrain>
        <state type="governance" notBefore="1944">
<p>Constitutional republic</p>
        </state>
        <state type="governance" notAfter="1944">
<p>Part of the kingdom of <placeName key="#DK">Denmark</placeName></p>
        </state>
        <event type="governance" from="1944-06-17">
<label>Independence</label>
<p> Iceland became independent on 17 June 1944.</p>
        </event>
      </place>
    </egXML>
  </p>
  <p>Like <gi>place</gi> elements, <gi>state</gi> and <gi>trait</gi> elements, and others
    of the same class, can be nested hierarchically within each other. When this is done,
    values for the <att>type</att> attribute are to be understood as cumulatively
    inherited, as elsewhere in the TEI scheme (for example on <gi>category</gi> or
      <gi>linkGrp</gi>). In the following example, the outermost <gi>population</gi>
    element concerns the squirrel population between the dates given. This is then broken
    down into red and gray squirrel populations, and within that into male and female:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <population type="squirrel" notBefore="1901" notAfter="1902-01-11" resp="#strabo">
        <population type="red" when="1901-01-10">
<population type="female">12</population>
<population type="male">15</population>
        </population>
        <population type="gray" when="1902-01-10" cert="high">
<population type="female">23</population>
<population type="male" cert="low" resp="#biber">45</population>
        </population>
      </population>
    </egXML> The dating and responsibility attributes here behave slightly differently
    from the <att>type</att> attribute: responsibility is not an additive property, and
    therefore an element either states it explicitly, or inherits it from its nearest
    ancestor. Dating is slightly different again, in that a child element may specify a
    date more precisely than its parent, as in the example above</p>
  <p>Events may also be subdivided into other events. For example, a two part meeting
    might be represented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <event type="meeting" date="2007-05-29">
        <event type="preamble" notAfter="13:00">
<desc>first part</desc>
        </event>
        <event type="conclusions" notBefore="13:00">
<desc>second part</desc>
        </event>
      </event>
    </egXML>
  </p>
</div>
<div xml:id="place-rel">
  <head>Relations between places</head>
  <p>The <gi>relation</gi> element may also be used to express relationships of various
    kinds between places, or between places and persons, in much the same way as it is
    used to express relationships between persons alone. Returning to the Mascarene
    Islands example cited above, we might define the island group and its constituents
    separately, but indicate the relationship by means of a <gi>relation</gi> element:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <listPlace>
        <place xml:id="MASC">
<placeName>Mascarene islands</placeName>
<placeName>Mascarenhas Archipelago</placeName>
        </place>
        <place xml:id="MRU">
<placeName>Mauritius</placeName>
<!-- ... -->
        </place>
        <place xml:id="ROD">
<placeName>Rodrigues</placeName>
        </place>
        <place xml:id="REN">
<placeName>Réunion</placeName>
        </place>
        <relation name="contains" active="#MASC" passive="#ROD #MRU #REN"/>
      </listPlace>
    </egXML>
  </p>
  <p>This <soCalled>stand off</soCalled> style of representation has the advantage that we
    can now also represent the fact that a place may be <q>part of</q> more than one other
    place; for example, Réunion is part of France, as well as part of the Mascarenes. If
    we add a declaration for France to the list above: <egXML
      xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <place type="country" xml:id="FRA">
        <placeName>France</placeName>
      </place>
    </egXML> we can now model this dual allegiance by means of a <gi>relation</gi>
    element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <relation name="partOf" active="#REN" passive="#FRA #MASC"/>
    </egXML>
  </p>
</div>
        </div>

<div type="div2" xml:id="NDORG"><head>Organizational names</head>

<p>In these Guidelines, we use the term <q>organization</q> for any
named collection of people regarded as a single unit. Typical examples
include businesses or institutions such as <soCalled>Harvard
College</soCalled> or <soCalled>the BBC</soCalled>, but also racial or
ethnic groupings or political factions where these are regarded as
forming a single agency such as <soCalled>the Scythians</soCalled> or
<soCalled>the Militant Tendency</soCalled>. Giving a loosely-defined
group of individuals a name often (and notoriously) serves a
particular political or social agenda and an analysis of the way such
phrases are constructed and used may therefore be of considerable
importance to the social historian, even where the objective existence
of an <q>organization</q> in this sense is harder to demonstrate than
that of (say) a named person. In the case of business or other
formally constituted institutions, the component parts of an
organizational name may help to characterize the organization in terms
of its perceived geographical location, ownership, likely number of
employees, management structure etc.</p>

<p>Like names of persons or places, organizational names can be marked
up as referring strings or as proper names with the <gi>rs</gi> or
<gi>name</gi> elements respectively.  The element <gi>orgName</gi> is
provided for use where it is desired to distinguish organizational
names more explicitly.  <specList><specDesc key="orgName"/></specList>
This element is a member of the same attribute classes as
<gi>persName</gi>, and therefore carries the following attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.naming" atts="key ref"/></specList>
</p>
<p>The <gi>orgName</gi> element may be used to mark up any form of
organizational name:  
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">About a year back, a question of considerable 
interest was agitated in the <orgName type="voluntary" key="PAS1">Pennsyla. Abolition Society</orgName></egXML>
<!-- From the Diary of Thomas Pym Cope -->
This encoding is equivalent to, but more specific than, either of the
following representations:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">About a year back, a question of considerable 
interest was agitated in the  <rs key="PAS1" type="org">
<name>Pennsyla. Abolition Society</name></rs>.</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">About a year back, a question of considerable 
interest was agitated in the 
<name key="PAS1" type="org">Pennsyla. Abolition 
Society</name>.</egXML>
As shown above, like the <gi>rs</gi> and <gi>name</gi> elements, the <gi>orgName</gi>
element has a <att>key</att> attribute with which an external
identifier such as a database key can be assigned to the organization
name, and also a <att>ref</att> attribute which can be used to point
directly to an <gi>org</gi> element containing information about the
organization itself (see further <ptr target="#ND-org"/>).  Its
<att>type</att> attribute should be used to characterize the name
(rather than the organization). An organizational name may take the
form of an acronym:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Mr Frost will be able to earn an extra fee from 
<orgName type="acronym">BSkyB</orgName>
rather than the
<orgName  type="acronym">BBC</orgName>
</egXML>

An organizational name is also often found as a phrase:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
The feeling in <country>Canada</country> is one of strong aversion to
the <orgName type="phrase">United States Government</orgName>, and of
predilection for self-government under the <orgName type="phrase">English Crown</orgName></egXML>
<!-- Anthony Trollope, North America, Penguin ed., 51 -->

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<orgName>The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu</orgName>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Within such phrases, it may be useful to identify name components,
as for other kinds of name:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<orgName type="partnerNames">
   <surname>Ernst</surname>&amp;<surname>Young</surname>
</orgName></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The names making up an organization names are not always
personal. They may also include place names: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">A spokesman from 
<orgName type="regional">
  <orgName>IBM</orgName>
  <country>UK</country>
</orgName> said ... 
</egXML>
or role names:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">THE TICKET which you will receive herewith has been formed by
the <orgName>Democratic Whig <name type="role">party</name>
</orgName> after the most careful deliberation,
with a reference to all the great objects of NATIONAL, STATE,
COUNTY and CITY concern, and with a single eye to the <hi>Welfare and Best Interests of the Community</hi>.</egXML>
</p>

<p>As indicated above, organizational names may also be specified 
hierarchically, for example where the named organization forms part of
a larger organizational entity.  <q>The
Department of Modern History, Glasgow University</q> is an
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><orgName>  
   <orgName>Department of Modern History</orgName>
   <orgName><name type="city">Glasgow</name>
            <name type="role">University</name>
   </orgName>
</orgName></egXML>
</p>
<p>The formal declaration of the elements discussed in this section include:
<specGrp xml:id="DNDORG" n="Organization names">
<!-- &orgName;-->
</specGrp>
</p>
</div>	
<div xml:id="ND-org"> <head>Organizational data</head>
<p>The <gi>org</gi> and <gi>listOrg</gi> elements are used to store
data about an organization such as its preferred name, its locations,
or key persons within it. These elements are intended to be used in a
way analogous to the <gi>place</gi> and <gi>person</gi> elements
discussed elsewhere in this chapter, that is to provide as a unique
wrapper element for information about an entity, distinct from
references to that entity which are typically encoded using a naming
element suich as <gi>name type="org"</gi> or <gi>orgName</gi>. The
content of a naming element will represent the way an organization is
named in a given context; the content of an <gi>org</gi> represents
the information known to the encoder about that organization, gathered
together in a single place, and independent of its textual realization.
</p>
<p>An organization is not the same thing as a list of people because
it has an identity of its own. That identity may be expressed solely
in the existence of a name (for example <q>The Scythians</q>), but is
likely to consist in the combination of that name with a number of
events, traits, or states which are considered to apply to the
organization itself, rather than any of its members. For example, a
sports team might be defined in terms of its membership (a
<gi>listPerson</gi>), its fixtures (a <gi>listEvent</gi>), its
geographical affiliation (a <gi>placeName</gi>), or any combination of
these. It will also have properties which may be used to categorize it
in some way such as the kind of sport played, whether the team is
amateur or professional, and so on: these are probably best dealt with
by means of the <att>type</att> attribute. However, it is the name of
the sports team alone which identifies it. </p>
<p>The content model for <gi>org</gi> therefore permits any mixture of
generic <gi>state</gi>, <gi>trait</gi>, or <gi>event</gi> elements,
and requires only the presence of the <gi>orgName</gi> element
described in <ptr target="#NDORG"/>.</p>
<p>In other respects, the <gi>org</gi> element is used in much the
same way as <gi>place</gi> or <gi>person</gi>. An organization may
have different names at different times:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><org><orgName
							 notAfter="1960">The Silver Beetles</orgName>
<orgName from="1960-08">The Beatles</orgName></org></egXML>  
</p>
<p>The names of the people making up an organization can also change
over time, (if they are known at all). For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><org><orgName
							 notAfter="1960">The Silver Beetles</orgName>
<orgName notBefore="1960">The Beatles</orgName>
<state type="membership" from="1960-08" to="1962-05">
<desc><persName>John Lennon</persName>
<persName>Paul McCartney</persName>
<persName>George Harrison</persName>
<persName>Stuart Sutcliffe</persName>
<persName>Pete Best</persName>
</desc></state>
<state type="membership" notBefore="1963">
<desc><persName>John Lennon</persName>
<persName>Paul McCartney</persName>
<persName>George Harrison</persName>
<persName>Ringo Starr</persName>
