        <p>[Abstract:] This article is the first article in a series that should
            help its readers getting started in the TEI. It explains the
            principles of text encoding and explains what to expect from the
            promised series of articles. It examines the reasons for using or
            not using TEI, and gives a full, albeit simplified, example of a
            real TEI text, showing the overall structure of a TEI document:
            header, facsimile, text consisting of front, body and back, and
            textual divisions. It also shows a number of optional extras that
            can help explain the text (notes), reconstructing the text's history
            (addition and deletion), or indexing the text (names and person
            description). </p>

    <head>Getting started using TEI: What is TEI?</head>
    <p>The article you are reading is the first installment in a series of
        articles that should help you getting started using TEI. The following
        instalments will appear in upcoming issues of TEI-EJ. The series cannot
        provide a full tutorial, and it cannot explain all of the detail of the
        underlying technologies, but it should make life a little easier for
        someone who is confronted with the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) for
        the first time. This article begins by giving a brief explanation of the
        TEI (<ptr target="#inovr"/>), and goes on to describe what you can
        expect from this article series (<ptr target="#indoc"/>). We then
        discuss the question of when to use and when not to use TEI (<ptr
            target="#inuse"/>). We give a first example of a complete TEI text
        in <ptr target="#inost"/>.</p>

        <head>TEI: a very high-level overview</head>
        <p>If you are reading this article you have probably decided, or are
            considering, using the TEI to create a digital version of one or
            more texts. Someone may have told you you should do so, or you may
            have read about other projects that used the TEI. So what is TEI,
            and why is it important? </p>
        <p>A common answer is to that question is that the TEI is <ref
                target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/">a set of Guidelines
                for the encoding of text</ref>. But TEI is not just a set of
            encodings and <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/"
                >Guidelines</ref> for using them. The TEI is also an <ref
                target="http://www.tei-c.org/">organization</ref> that maintains
            these Guidelines, and a community of users that applies the
            Guidelines. In fact the users are the organization: the TEI is a
            consortium of universities, libraries and research organizations,
            and the TEI <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/About/board.xml"
                >Board</ref> and <ref
                target="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/">Council</ref>
            are elected by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Membership/"
                >member organizations</ref>. Using TEI is taking part in the
            community of TEI users that meet on the <ref
                target="http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A0=tei-l"
                >TEI mailing list</ref>, in Special Interest Groups, at the
            yearly TEI member meeting and on other occasions. </p>

        <p>But what is <emph>Text Encoding</emph>? Text encoding is the addition
            of codes to text in order to make it possible for a computer to
            process that text. Text encoding assumes, usually, that you already
            have a text, either by manually transcribing it, or by using an
                <term target="getstartgloss.xml#ocr">OCR</term> program. The
            codes that you add to the text will describe some aspect of the
            text: either by adding information such as author or place of
            publication (metadata), or by characterizing the role, meaning or
            other properties of pieces of text. The title of this chapter, to
            give a very simple example, might be encoded as:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <head>TEI: A very high-level overview</head>
        </egXML>
        <p>You might ask why we do this. Word processing software, like
            Microsoft Word, can after all handle text very well without us
            having to type codes in pointing brackets. The long answer is given
            in another article in this series (<ref target="#dm">The rationale
                of declarative markup</ref>), but a shorter answer is that
            explicit coding gives you (the editor of the text) control over your
            text and its application, something you don't have when you use a
            commercial word processor. For an office document that may not
            represent a problem, but for a text that you edit you probably do
            not want to depend on the standard facilities that were created to
            handle business documents. And while it is true that there are
            programs that can compute wordlists and complex concordances,
            without any need for explicit codes, that is only true for
            individual texts without structure and only provides limited means
            for interrogation of these texts. Once you have multiple texts you
            need a way to associate texts with titles, and if your text consists
            of poetry with a prose commentary, you may want to have word counts
            by type of text. That is to say: you need a structured
            representation of text properties, and that is what text encoding
            provides.</p>
        <p>If you know something about web pages, you may think by now that text
            encoding is like using <term target="getstartgloss.xml#html"
                >HTML</term>, the language of the web. Isn’t the <gi>head</gi>
            that we saw just now very much like the various <gi>h1</gi>,
                <gi>h2</gi>, … elements that HTML uses to encode headers at
            various levels? And indeed, the encodings that the TEI uses
            (so-called <term>tag</term>s between angle brackets), is very
            similar to HTML's formalism, and some of the tags it shares with
            HTML (such as <gi>p</gi> for paragraph and <gi>div</gi> for textual
            division). The formalism is called <term
                target="getstartgloss.xml#xml">XML</term> (more about it in the
                <ref target="#tbxml">Technical Background</ref> article in this
            series). What makes TEI different from HTML is that the TEI provides
            tags for many different text types (e.g. verse, drama, dictionaries,
            spoken texts) and many different sorts of properties (to document
            e.g. a bibliographical description, or textual genesis), and that
            each of these tags has an explicit, well-documented meaning. To give
            an example: you can represent a play in HTML, but HTML has no
            special tags to indicate a speech, or a stage direction. TEI does
            have these, and a computer program that reads a TEI representation
            of a play can use that knowledge, e.g. to create an index of
            speeches by character or search only within a certain character's
            lines. It would be significantly more difficult to do so from an
            HTML representation.</p>
        <p>Your next question might be: so, once I have a TEI-encoded version of
            my text (i.e. an XML file that uses TEI tags), can I put that text
            on the web? The answer is: yes you can, but not without one further
            step. You need some sort of program that can turn your encoded text
            into a web page or collection of web pages. Remember, during the
            encoding process you explicitly describe the structure of your text,
            such as verse lines, headings, notes, etc. But you say nothing about
            how you want these to be represented on the web, or how you want
            them to be printed. There is a very good reason for this. For most
            texts, there is not a single best way to represent their content.
            One of the reasons why we do text encoding is that we want to do
            multiple things with the texts (e.g. show them on the web, present a
            search facility that can search by chapter, index personal names,
            etc.); for that very reason, presentation functionality is kept
            outside of the text. The idea is that the encoding should not be
            created for a single application program. Programs come and go; the
            encoding remains.</p>
        <p>There are many programming languages and other tools that can be used
            to create a web page out of an XML file, but by far the most common
            is <term target="getstartgloss.xml#xslt">XSLT</term>. We apply what
            is called an XSLT stylesheet to an XML file to transform it into one
            or more web pages. XSLT stylesheets can do much more than apply what
            one would ordinarily call 'style' to a document. They can define
            complex transformations including sorting, grouping, filtering,
            aggregation, and selection. The TEI provides a set of general sample
            stylesheets that can handle many types of text, but usually some
            stylesheet programming is necessary to create a suitable set of web
            pages for a project. The amount of programming depends very much on
            the ambition level and the properties of the text. More about XSLT
            in the <ref target="#tbxml">Technical Background</ref> and <ref
                target="#st">Running stylesheets</ref> articles in this series.
            (By the way, there is also another type of stylesheet, viz. <term
                target="getstartgloss.xml#css">CSS</term> stylesheets. CSS
            stylesheets define simpler rendering styles for XML or HTML (web)
            pages, including things like margins, colours, font sizes, etc.)</p>
        <p>Two more questions that often come up when discussing TEI are (1)
            must I create this encoding by hand? And (2) can I modify the TEI
            encodings and add my own tags? As to the first question, the answer
            is: to some extent. Usually, people create XML files with a program
            called an XML editor (more in the <ref target="#ed">Choosing and
                installing an editor</ref> article in this series). Most modern
            XML editors can help you create the encoding, based on a <term
                target="getstartgloss.xml#sch">schema</term>. The schema defines
            what tags are allowed and where they are allowed, and the XML editor
            can prompt the user with a list of the allowed tags. The program can
            also check whether the tags that are used are actually allowed, in a
            process called <term target="getstartgloss.xml#val"
                >validation</term>. Some XML editors can show the definitions of
            these tags during editing, or adjust the layout and formatting of
            the text based on the tags that are used. Some offer a tagless
            interface for editing. All of these help very much in making XML
            editing a fairly straightforward process, depending on your
            background.</p>
        <p>As to the second question: yes, you can modify the TEI encoding when
            your text has properties that the existing encodings really do not
            handle adequately. You can describe the extra tags that you need, or
            the ones that you need to change, in a special document called a
                TEI<term target="getstartgloss.xml#odd">ODD</term> file. The TEI
            provides a web application called <term
                target="getstartgloss.xml#roma">Roma</term> (<ptr
                target="http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/"/>) which helps create such a
            document. Roma can also generate a schema from the ODD document.
            That schema, as we just saw, helps you create and validate your TEI
            document. Much more about this in the <ref target="#sc">Defining,
                Creating and Using TEI Schemas</ref> article in this series.</p>
        <p>The technologies that we have mentioned in this subsection (TEI, XML,
            HTML, XSLT, Schema’s, and XML editors) are more or less what will be
            discussed in the remainder of this series of articles. </p>

    <!-- Should this be moved earlier?  -->
    <div xml:id="indoc">
        <head>What this article series does, and what it does not</head>
        <p>If you have toyed around with downloading computer programs, you will
            have read 'Getting started with xyz' documents. Usually they are one
            or two pages long. The Getting Started-series that you are reading
            now may be about 50 pages long. That means that, depending on your
            purposes, it will probably take you longer to get started using TEI
            than it takes to get to use your average computer program. The
            reason for this is that you are not just learning to use a computer
            program; you are learning a new view of text, a vocabulary for
            expressing that view, a formalism for writing that vocabulary,
                <emph>and</emph> a set of programs for manipulating that
            formalism. The effort will depend on your existing skills, on your
            environment (do you have people around that can help you when you're
            stuck) and on your ambitions. </p>
        <p>If you have had no previous experience of some of the more technical
            aspects of computing, getting to use TEI is going to present you
            with a sometimes steep learning curve. But then, having learned to
            use TEI will not just enable you to encode, present and analyse your
            documents, you will also have acquired a deeper understanding of
            your texts, and text in general, you will have mastered a set of
            technologies that will be of use throughout your professional life,
            and you will have met with a crowd of friendly and innovative
            scholars, programmers and librarians that may also prove to be an
            asset in your career as well as a reward in itself.</p>
        <p>So, recognising that learning TEI is never going to be easy, this
            series of articles will help you get started. It is not a full
            course. Neither can it provide a substantive tutorial in the main
            technologies that TEI uses, such as <term
                target="getstartgloss.xml#xml">XML</term>, <term
                target="getstartgloss.xml#xslt">XSLT</term> and <term
                target="getstartgloss.xml#html">HTML</term>. We refer to
            tutorials and online training opportunities elsewhere wherever
            possible.</p>
        <p>The article series aims to serve a diverse audience. Its readers may
            include academics (postgraduate, PhD, researcher, professor) who
            want to start understanding and using the TEI: e.g. a graduate
            student who wants to make an edition of a book he/she is writing a
            thesis on. The audience may also include people who are not
            themselves scholars but who are, or will be, working as encoders
            with a project. These may be undergraduates, editorial assistants,
            etc. We assume readers that are willing to learn something new,
            ready to work hard and to try various solutions. We also assume
            someone that is reasonably comfortable using computers, but do not
            expect experience in programming or previous knowledge of XML or
            HTML. </p>
        <p>By 'reasonably comfortable using computers' we mean, among other
            things, that we expect you to have basic computer skills, such as
            create disk folders, move files, download and install programs, and
            use <term target="getstartgloss.xml#zip">zip/unzip</term> software.
            There is no point in this document trying to explain very elementary
            computer tasks. If you feel your basic computer skills are
            inadequate, you may want to attend elementary computer training or
            study a beginner's tutorial.</p>
        <p>After this initial article, the following article will describe a
            number of technologies that the TEI uses in text encoding (<ptr
                target="#tb"/>). The reasons for encoding properties of the text
            rather than the desired output are examined in <ptr target="#dm"/>.
            The series then goes on to discuss (in <ptr target="#ed"/>) XML
            editing software, the principal tool for creating and modifying TEI
            texts. Once we have an editor we can load, modify and validate TEI
            documents (<ptr target="#lm"/>). We use stylesheets (<ptr
                target="#st"/>) to transform XML documents into other documents,
            e.g. to read them on the web. Once you have seen this, you will want
            to begin using this on your own texts (<ptr target="#ot"/>). </p>
        <p>A final piece of technology that is explained in the series are XML
            schemas <ptr target="#sc"/>. By using schemas we describe exactly
            which elements can occur in a given XML document, and what elements
            they may contain. Using the description, we can check the validity
            of the XML document. That is one of the reasons that we want to
            define schemas that closely fit the documents that we are encoding.
            The TEI provides a mechanism for creating such schemas. What remains
            then is to ask what to do once you have studied the series (<ptr
                target="#wg"/>). The article series comes with a Glossary (<ptr
                target="getstartgloss.xml"/>) of technical terms. </p>
        <p>This article series should be useful irrespective of the computer
            platform you are using (Windows, Unix, Apple). In fact, an important
            reason why the TEI was created was that computer files tended to be
            specific to a single platform. Work that scholars did to encode
            historic texts was lost when platforms changed. Platform
            independence is therefore very important to the TEI. The software
            that we discuss runs on all major platforms, though things may not
            look exactly the same everywhere. Where we have to describe things
            that are specific to one or more platforms, we will clearly indicate
            this.</p>

    <div xml:id="inuse">
        <head>When to use and when not to use TEI?</head>
        <p>The TEI Guidelines have been in development over a period of more
            than 20 years. They have grown into a quite formidable apparatus for
            tackling textual issues that may appear intimidating at first. It is
            not uncommon for people to wonder: do I have to do this? Isn't there
            an easier alternative, something closer to the techniques that I
            already know? This section will discuss situations when using TEI is
            appropriate and when it is less so.</p>
        <p>To be clear, you can encode any form of text-bearing object, and even
            objects that don't have any text, in TEI. People also use the TEI to
            record only metadata about objects. If you are undertaking a
            text-encoding project in linguistics, social sciences, library
            sciences, or humanities then it is likely that the TEI is a good fit
            for your needs. Nonetheless there are situations where the use of
            TEI may be overkill or otherwise less appropriate.</p>
        <div>
            <head>Why not just HTML?</head>
            <p>Quite frequently people know that their main publication output
                will be in HTML on the web, and they question whether they
                should not just author directly in HTML. As mentioned earlier in
                this document the TEI has more and more specific elements than
                HTML. Experience has taught that it is more useful to describe
                what something is, rather than what it looks like. Therefore,
                while in HTML encoding you might want to display in italics
                something that is a title, emphasized, a foreign phrase, or a
                specialized term, in TEI one would mark this with specific
                elements for titles, emphasis, foreign phrases, or terms. The
                benefit of this is the easy ability to repurpose the material
                for different uses. Also, by separating out the presentation
                from the encoding it allows one to easily change the form of
                presentation for all similar elements at a later date. Another
                example would be line numbers. If you edit in HTML, you either
                use line numbers or you do not. If you use TEI you mark the
                line-breaks in your text as such, creating the basis for
                producing an HTML text with line numbers and one without.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>What is your material like?</head>
            <p>For many genres (prose, poetry, plays, dictionaries, charters,
                language corpora and more) examples exist of successful TEI
                encoding. The TEI website contains a <ref
                    target="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/">list of
                    projects</ref> using TEI that can inspire prospective
                encoders. But one reason not to use TEI could be that for your
                genre or discipline there is an existing standard which suits
                your needs better. For example, if you are encoding a
                mathematical manuscript then the Mathematical Markup Language
                (MathML; <ref target="#carl2003">Carlisle 2003</ref>)
                recommendation from the W3C is mostly likely a better choice.
                That said, if you are editing documents which contain
                mathematical formulas but also exhibit textual variation, TEI
                would be a better choice, as you can encode the textual
                variation using TEI features and embed MathML in your document
                to describe the formulas. This ability to be able to incorporate
                other standards as part of a TEI document is one of its many
                strengths. Many other standards exist and the TEI has tried not
                to reinvent the wheel where a perfectly good one exists, instead
                allowing you to embed markup from other vocabularies in your TEI
                document where necessary. Additionally if the TEI does not cater
                for some textual phenomena important to your work, then it is
                possible and even recommended to extend the TEI (in an approved
                and documented manner) to add new elements to deal with
                these.</p>
            <p>Another technology that people use frequently instead of the TEI,
                or other forms of XML, is relational databases. It makes sense
                to use a standard relational database when the nature of the
                data benefits from this form of storage and retrieval. One way
                to think about this division of information is whether it is
                data-like or document-like. Relational databases are good at
                storing single static fields where no markup is present in any
                of the fields. XML is good at deeply-nested, arbitrary, fields.
                An example might be an address and telephone list. If one is
                simply recording a flat list of names, phone numbers, and some
                address lines then a relational database is possibly certainly
                sufficient. If the individual fields contain anything you want
                to record inside any of them then using a structured markup
                language like TEI XML is probably more suitable. So-called
                'document-like' information is often characterised by multiple
                levels of nesting of structures, for example divisions
                containing paragraphs containing various phrase-level markup
                such as names, abbreviations, or foreign phrases. See <ref
                    target="#brad2005">Bradley &amp; Short (2005)</ref> for a
                discussion of some of these issues.</p>
            <p>In some cases, source material may contain structures which
                cannot be represented in TEI markup (say you are visually
                representing a ballet performance). In these cases TEI is
                clearly not the answer (though it might be an ingredient in a
                solution). However, it may also be the case that your material
                could be represented in TEI but the discipline you are working
                in has a significant number of tools and expertise available for
                another format. This will necessarily be a factor in the format
                you choose.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>What is your desired output?</head>
            <p>It is one of the basic ideas of descriptive markup that the
                presentation and output should be left as a separate step from
                the encoding of the information. Part of the reason for this is
                that one is able to leverage the markup available in a TEI
                document to produce all sorts of outputs. (e.g. not only a
                rendering of a text, but indices of certain aspects,
                rearrangements or different views, and any number of statistics)
                The TEI provides basic customisable XSLT stylesheets for
                transforming TEI texts to HTML and PDF, and additionally there
                are ways to import and export TEI to/from word processors. One
                of the benefits of using XML as a format is that it is fairly
                easy to transform XML into other formats required for later
                software. The need to create output in multiple forms or formats
                is a clear reason for choosing TEI. Conversely, if your output
                is to be accessed only in a single format, other than TEI, then
                choosing that other format may be more suitable. Still, we would
                argue for carefully considering the potential advantages of
                multiple output forms.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>How hard is learning TEI, and where do I get help?</head>
            <p>The competence of the person undertaking the encoding is
                necessarily a consideration in choosing technologies. However,
                it should be emphasized that a fairly good understanding of
                basic TEI XML can be obtained quite quickly in comparison to
                many of the other skills people learn in order to undertake
                similar scholarly activities. Spending a few days learning TEI
                XML is an investment of time that is well worthwhile. That said,
                such an undertaking does presuppose a certain amount of basic
                computer literacy. It is worth remembering that in some cases it
                may also be possible to out-source the required TEI encoding of
                your documents. One good reason for using the TEI is that there
                is a large international community who are willing to help you
                as you encounter problems. Nonetheless, if the context in which
                you are undertaking the encoding (workplace, institution, etc.)
                provides no support for TEI or XML, and actively supports
                alternative solutions, then that should certainly be borne in
                mind. What would be more beneficial, of course, is educate your
                colleagues as to the benefits of the TEI, and perhaps host a TEI
                Workshop with invited speakers to help train your local
                technical support. There are many scholars with basic computer
                literacy who have been more than able to teach themselves the
                TEI. There are also materials from many <ref
                    target="http://www.tei-c.org/Support/Learn/">TEI
                    Workshops</ref> available online.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head>Do long-term benefits outweigh initial costs?</head>
            <p>One of the benefits of using the TEI is that what you do is
                specifying the textual distinctions that are useful for your
                purposes. This is intellectually more satisfying than only
                encoding for one platform such as web distribution. And yet, if
                you have no experience with the TEI, and simply need to do a
                single web page very quickly, then deciding to learn the TEI,
                and investigating the various options for transformation to
                HTML, is probably not as quick. We would argue, of course, that
                learning TEI is never time spent poorly.</p>

            <head>But can markup do justice to my text?</head>
            <p>There is a school of thought that holds that XML markup cannot do
                justice to the phenomena that literary scholars study. The main
                reasons for these doubts are that <list type="simple">
                    <item>(i) XML encodes hierarchical structures, while most of
                        the phenomena that literary scholars are interested in
                        cross hierarchical boundaries: Quotations run across
                        paragraph boundaries, speeches in plays overlap with
                        metrical units in poetry, and textual variation is also
                        insensitive to structural boundaries; </item>
                    <item>(ii) XML encoding is often perceived as inflexible and
                        rigid, not suited to represent the creative process of
                        scholarly discovery; </item>
                    <item>(iii) the need to learn and consider the
                        technicalities of XML encoding is sometimes thought to
                        be at odds with the scholarly work which the encoding
                        should after all facilitate.</item>
                </list> See for a forceful statement of these views e.g. <ref

            <p>Should these criticisms keep you from using TEI XML? It should not
                come as surprise that we do not think so. This tutorial is not
                the right place for an in-depth discussion of these fundamental
                criticisms of XML as a format. It is true that overlap between
                textual phenomena can be a cause of complexity in text encoding, but there are a
                numerous of ways of dealing with them and for the majority of people it is
                usually not a problem. As to the perception of inflexibility: it is
                clearly unwise to begin TEI encoding of a text without previous
                thought about the phenomena worth researching and worth tagging
                    (<ref target="#lava2006">Lavagnino 2006</ref>). However,
                when preparing a (collection of) text(s) for publication, some
                measure of uniformity is necessary, whether one uses XML or not.
                And in fact the use of XML can be argued to increase
                flexibility, as it facilitates multiple presentations of the
                text. Finally, while it is undoubtedly true that heavily marked
                up text can become difficult to read, this is more of an
                interface problem than an XML limitation. The problem may be
                alleviated by a tagless editing interface in XML editors or by
                editing applications that hide the existence of XML altogether.
                Another solution may be the use of so-called <term
                    target="getstartgloss.xml#som">stand-off markup</term>, i.e.
                markup that is not embedded within the text that it comments on
                but that points to segments of that text.</p>

            <head>TEI and the history of digital text</head>
            <p>Summing up, there is no single answer to the question when to use
                TEI. The decision will depend on characteristics of the texts,
                the discipline, the persons and the project involved. A final
                consideration may be the unique place of the TEI in the history
                of the development of digital textual studies, digital
                humanities and the way we conceive of electronic text in the
                modern age. As the TEI was originally a pre-web endeavour, its
                decisions have helped to influence many of the people who have
                designed the systems, formats and processes which make up the
                web, including XML itself (see <ref target="#dero1999">DeRose
                    1999</ref> and <ref target="#barn1995">Barnard et al.
                    1995</ref>).</p>
            <p>If embarking on a text encoding project of any sort, it will do
                one no harm to examine the current TEI Guidelines. They have
                been developed and updated over the last couple of decades with
                input from countless scholars and experts from many fields. They
                have been revised again and again to introduce new concepts,
                expand older ones, and correct mistakes. This does not mean that
                there is no room for improvement, but simply that they have
                benefited from a long history of many eyes and experience with
                all sorts of texts. The Guidelines then provide a good
                codification of knowledge about the markup of various textual
                phenomena. It is quite likely that your problems and concerns
                are not unique and that others have encountered similar textual
                phenomena before you. After all, damage to the carving on a
                stone tablet is very similar, in a structural sense, to damage
                to a text in a medieval manuscript, or indeed a modern printed
                book rescued from a fire. For many text types, if you decide not
                to use TEI, you are likely to have to reinvent several
                wheels.</p>

        <head>Overall structure of a TEI text</head>
        <p>To introduce the structure of a TEI document, we will begin at the
            level of a smaller text fragment, and then gradually add the larger
            document structure around it. Our example is based on the <ref
                target="#grav2002">Diary of Robert Graves</ref>. For educational
            purposes, the encoding that we will show here is slightly different

                of a number of paragraphs. We introduce some XML elements and

            <p>A fuller explanation of <term target="getstartgloss.xml#xml"
                    >XML</term> will be given in the <ref target="#tb">Technical
                    Background</ref> article in this series. For now, we will
                limit the explanation to saying that that XML <term
                    target="getstartgloss.xml#elem">element</term>s such as 'p'
                (paragraph) are delimited by what is called <term
                    target="getstartgloss.xml#tag">tag</term>s. An opening tag
                looks like '&lt;p>', a closing tag looks like '&lt;/p>'. In
                running prose, we use the opening tag in discussing the element.
                Elements can have properties attached to them by specifying
                    <term target="getstartgloss.xml#attr">attribute</term>s, as
                in the <gi>div</gi> element in the example. When discussing an
                attribute, we will prefix its name with '@', as in
                    '<att>type</att>'. </p>
            <p>The <gi>div</gi> element is what is used to describe textual
                divisions. We use here the <att>n</att> attribute to indicate
                the date, and the <att>type</att> attribute to state this piece
                of text is a diary entry. <gi>head</gi> is used to describe a
                heading, <gi>p</gi> describes a paragraph. A question might be
                why we don't simply indicate paragraphs by newline characters,
                the way many programs do (such as Notepad on Windows). One
                reason is that different operating systems use different
                characters to indicate the beginning of a new line. Another
                reason is that an accidental new line character in our source
                would cause a rendering application to begin a new paragraph.
                The best way to avoid ambiguity and to make our encoding
                portable between platforms is to explicitly indicate new
                paragraphs. We might, in fact, even have indicated the locations
                where Graves begins a new line. TEI provides the <gi>lb</gi>
                element for that purpose. This, as most other decisions about
                encoding, is a matter of editorial choice. Is the beginning of a
                new line important enough to be retained in an edition? The TEI
                does not prescribe editorial policies. </p>
            <p>Before moving on to the larger document structure, we will add a
                few more refinements. Not every project will find these
                refinements necessary, but they give an indication of the kind
                of phenomena TEI can handle. To begin with, the word
                    <q>fugon</q> is a word taken from Spanish, and should
                probably be italicised in an edition. We use the
                    <gi>foreign</gi> element to indicate this. To explain what
                it means, we add a <gi>note</gi>. Then, there is a small drawing
                of a cup, which our transcription renders as <q>[sketch of
                    cup]</q>. From the transcription, no-one would know that
                these are not Graves' own words. We will use a <gi>figure</gi>
                element and an embedded <gi>figDesc</gi> (figure description) to
                place the description. We will also indicate that <q>ch</q> is
                an abbreviation (for 'chapter'). And finally, we will want to
                indicate a number of changes that Graves made in his text. We
                will use <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi> elements to indicate
                deletions and additions to the text. The result is as
                follows:</p>

        <div xml:id="oscon">
            <head>The larger document structure</head>
            <p>Texts do not live in isolation. They are often introduced by
                title pages, prefaces, tables of contents and dedications; they
                are often followed by an index, appendices, and similar
                material. We represent this structure by a <gi>text</gi> element
                that contains a <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi> and <gi>back</gi>.
                In our case, the editors of Graves' correspondence have created
                monthly abstracts of the diary entries. These might very well
                have been placed in the <gi>front</gi> element. Supposing for
                the moment that there is no other front matter and no back
                matter, that would give us this: </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                </text>
            </egXML>
            <p>Notice, by the way, the use of <![CDATA[<!-- ...  -->]]> to write
                comments in XML text. Comments are used to explain something
                about the encoding to a human reader and will usually be ignored
                by programs that process the XML.</p>
            <p>Apart from the texts that surround a main text, such as forewords
                and appendices, TEI texts are also provided with metadata,
                information <emph>about</emph> the text. All TEI texts come with
                a header that contains these metadata. The element is called
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi>. The <gi>teiHeader</gi> and the
                    <gi>text</gi> are children of the top level <gi>TEI</gi>
                element. So the overall structure looks like this:</p>

            </egXML>
            <p>Notice the 'xmlns' on the <gi>TEI</gi> element: all TEI elements
                are part of the TEI <term target="getstartgloss.xml#ns"

            <p>We will not go into details here about the content of the TEI

            <p>The encoding that we have shown up to now is of course only a
                very partial encoding. We will show two ways of creating a more
                informative document.</p>
            <div xml:id="osreffac">
                <head>Attaching a facsimile</head>
                <p>First, we may want to make explicit the relation between the
                    image file that we transcribed and the transcribed content.
                    For that purpose, the TEI provides the <gi>facsimile</gi>
                    element, stored between the <gi>teiHeader</gi> and the
                        <gi>text</gi> elements. The <gi>facsimile</gi> element
                    describes the transcribed object in terms of
                        <gi>surface</gi>s and (optionally) <gi>zone</gi>s within
                    these surfaces. In our case, each surface will correspond
                    with a diary page, and we have no need for zones. For each
                    surface, we can define one or more <gi>graphic</gi>
                    elements, which will hold information about the images of
                    that page. The surface element is provided with an
                        <att>xml:id</att> attribute. From the transcription we
                    can point at the <gi>surface</gi> using the <att>facs</att>
                    attribute. Let us see what this looks like:</p>
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <TEI>
                        <teiHeader> ... </teiHeader>
                        <facsimile>
                            <surface xml:id="graves1938-10-10-1">
                                <graphic url="graves1938-10-10.jpg"/>
                            </surface>
                        </facsimile>
                        <text>
                            <front>...</front>
                            <body>
                                <div type="diaryentry" n="1938-10-10"
                                    facs="#graves1938-10-10-1"> ... </div>
                            </body>
                        </text>
                    </TEI>
                </egXML>
                <p>You see we have added a <gi>facsimile</gi> element containing
                    a <gi>surface</gi> for the page that we transcribed. The
                        <gi>surface</gi> has an <att>xml:id</att> attribute. On
                    the <gi>div</gi> element in the transcription we have added
                    a <att>facs</att> attribute. The value of the
                        <att>facs</att> attribute is a <term
                        target="getstartgloss.xml#url">url</term>. The value
                    '#graves1938-10-10-1' points to the element with
                        <att>xml:id</att> attribute 'graves1938-10-10-1', that
                    is, the <gi>surface</gi> element. The <gi>surface</gi>
                    element contains the <gi>graphic</gi> element that is an
                    image of the current page. </p>
                <p>The reason we do this is that we have now explicitly defined
                    the relation between the transcription and the corresponding
                    image files. Later users of the transcription will know what
                    belongs together. What may be more important: applications
                    that want to render the transcription will no longer need to
                    know about the names of the image files. They can just fetch
                    the files that are needed from the location as it is
                    specified in the Guidelines. It is an important step towards
                    making general-purpose TEI applications. </p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="osrefper">
                <head>Repurposeable notes about persons</head>
                <p>A further enhancement of the document's value would be to
                    provide some explanations about the many persons mentioned,
                    but not identified, in the diary entries. We could create
                        <gi>note</gi> elements, the way we did to explain
                        <mentioned>fugon</mentioned>, but most persons recur
                    many times throughout the diary. What we would like to have
                    is a single explanation per person, that we can show
                    whenever it is needed. </p>
                <p>One way to create such reusable explanations is to make use
                    of the participant description in the TEI header. The
                        <gi>particDesc</gi> element can contain a list of
                    persons (a <gi>listPerson</gi> element containing
                        <gi>person</gi>s). For each <gi>person</gi> we could, if
                    we wanted to do so, give a structured description in terms
                    of a number of characteristics (sex, age, etc). But we can
                    also limit ourselves to an informal description using a
                        <gi>p</gi> element. Whenever a specific person occurs in
                    the diary, we can then refer to the description of that
                    person in the header. The element that we will use to refer
                    to the description is the <gi>rs</gi> element. The
                        <gi>rs</gi> element (referring string) is somewhat like
                    a name element, but more generic: names are referring
                    strings, but so are 'her oldest son' or 'the gardener'.
                    Which gives us something like this: </p>

                <p>For three persons in the diary fragment, we have created a
                        <gi>person</gi> element. We have surrounded the names in
                    the diary with <gi>rs</gi> tags and let the <gi>rs</gi>
                    elements point to the <gi>person</gi>s using the
                        <att>ref</att> attribute. </p>
                <p>This concludes the discussion of our first TEI example. The
                    choices made in the encoding of this diary fragment are not
                    meant to suggest what is mandatory and what not: the
                    editorial policies of individual projects must decide, e.g.,
                    whether to retain or to expand abbreviations or to do both.
                    Similarly, a transcription that ignores deleted text can be
                    perfectly valid TEI. Decisions about what to encode should
                    be driven by research interest (and, inevitably, practical
                    feasibility).</p>

        <head>Summary</head>
        <p>In this article, we have given an overview of the TEI for those that
            want to get started applying it. We gave a high-level overview of
            what TEI encoding is, and explained the thinking behind the series
            of articles of which this one is the first instalment. We discussed
            the circumstances under which applying the TEI makes sense, and when
            it does not. Finally, we gave an extended example of the overall
            structure of a TEI text. We saw that a TEI text always contains a
            header (<gi>teiHeader</gi>) that describes that text. The text
            itself (<gi>text</gi>) may, in addition to the text <gi>body</gi>,
            contain <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi> matter. Additionally, a TEI
            encoded text may contain a <gi>facsimile</gi> element that relates
            the transcription to the pages that have been transcribed and to
            images of these pages. The transcription itself is usually
            structured using <gi>div</gi> element for the textual divisions,
            which in their turn will contain <gi>p</gi> elements (if we are
            dealing with prose). </p>
        <p>We also saw a number of extras: we identified abbreviations, we
            encoded additions and deletions, and annotated references to
            persons. As said earlier, there is nothing in the TEI which obliges
            us to provide that information. Decisions about the whether to
            encode such features depend, among other things, on the text being
            edited, type of edition that is being planned, and the resources
            that are available. For those, however, that want to encode them,
            the TEI provides the necessary mechanisms. </p>
        <p>But what exactly is XML, and why are we using it? Why do we provide
            our texts with this type of encoding at all? Why don't we use a
                <term target="getstartgloss.xml#wys">wysiwyg</term> editing
            environment, the way modern word processors do? How can we process
            files such as the one we saw? The next instalments in this series
            will deal in depth with some of the questions that we could only
            touch upon in this article.</p>
