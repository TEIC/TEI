      <p>Release 3.5.0, the “Raven Release” (so named because Poe’s famous poem was first published
        under his name on January 29th) of the TEI Guidelines introduces new features and resolves a
        number of issues raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and
        corrections are a consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community
        using the GitHub tracking system. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this
        release cycle may be found under the <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Guidelines+3.5.0%22+is%3Aclosed">3.5.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>Highlights of this release include: <list>

          <item>New elements have been introduced to name, describe, identify and list objects (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/327">#327</ref>): <list>

              <item>The <gi>objectName</gi> element contains a proper noun or noun phrase used to
                refer to an object.</item>

              <item>The <gi>listObject</gi> element contains a list of descriptions, each of which
                provides information about an identifiable physical object.</item>

              <item>The <gi>object</gi> element contains a description of a single identifiable
                physical object.</item>

              <item>The <gi>objectIdentifier</gi> element groups one or more identifiers or pieces
                of locating information concerning a single object.</item>

              <item>Guidelines prose has been created for <title>Objects</title> in chapter <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDOBJ">13.3.5</ref> and for <title>Object names</title> in chapter <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDOBJN">13.2.4</ref>.</item>

              <item>Minor modifications have been made to the descriptions of
                <gi>msDesc</gi>-related items to enable use for 'other objects'.</item>
            </list>
            <note>The object element is a recent addition to the TEI P5 Guidelines as of version
              3.5.0 and as such may be more prone to further revision in the next few releases as
              its use develops. This may be particularly evident where its contents have been
              borrowed from <gi>msDesc</gi> and have yet to be generalized from their use in the
              context of manuscript descriptions.</note></item>

          <item>The Schematron deprecation warning on <gi>secFol</gi>, <gi>signatures</gi>, and
              <gi>catchwords</gi> has been changed to an outright error when used outside of
              <gi>msDesc</gi> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1479">#1479</ref>).</item>

          <item>A new example using the <att>source</att> attribute on <gi>schemaSpec</gi> has been
            added (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1593">#1593</ref>).</item>

          <item>The description on <name type="class">att.lexicographic</name> has been improved
              (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1720">#1720</ref>).</item>

          <item>With the addition of model.qLike to macro.phraseSeq (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1531">#1531</ref>), <gi>incipit</gi> can
            now contain <gi>quote</gi>, <gi>q</gi>, and <gi>cit</gi> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1755">#1755</ref>).</item>

              <gi>entry</gi>, <gi>entryFree</gi>, and <gi>superEntry</gi> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1819">#1819</ref>).</item>

          <item>The <gi>witDetail</gi> element has been removed from <name type="class">model.noteLike</name> along with the clarification on the use of <att>source</att>
            rather than <att>resp</att> and the <gi>wit</gi> element vs. the <att>wit</att>

      </p>

        translations we especially thank Kiyonori Nagasaki and Martin Holmes.</p>

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://roma.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and <ref target="http://oxgarage.tei-c.org/">OxGarage</ref> as well as other TEI conversions). The
