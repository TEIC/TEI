        <head>Prefatory note</head>
        <p>TEI Lite was the name adopted for what the TEI editors originally conceived of as a simple
        demonstration of how the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) encoding scheme might be adopted to
        meet 90% of the needs of 90% of the TEI user community. In retrospect, it was predictable that
        many people should imagine TEI Lite to be all there is to TEI, or find TEI Lite to be far too
        heavy for their needs.</p>
        <p>The original TEI Lite (1996) was based largely on observations of existing and previous
        practice in the encoding of texts, particularly as manifest in the
        collections of the <ref target="https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Text Archive</ref> and other collections of the period.
        It is therefore unsurprising that it seems to have become, if not a <foreign xml:lang="la">de
        facto</foreign> standard, at least a common point of departure for electronic text centres and
        encoding projects world wide. Maybe the fact that we actually produced this shortish, readable,
        manual for it also helped.</p>
        <p>Early adopters of TEI Lite included a number of <soCalled>Electronic Text Centers</soCalled>
        <!-- , many
             of whom produced their own documentation and
             tutorial materials (some examples are listed in
             <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Tutorials/"> the
             TEI Tutorials pages</ref>)-->
        and digital library initiatives. It was also adopted as the basis for some early TEI-conformant
        authoring systems, and as the basis for introductory tutorials, many of them in languages other
        than English (see further the list of legacy versions at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P4/Lite/"/>).</p>
        <p>In 2002, following the publication of TEI P4, the XML version of the TEI Guidelines, which
        uses the generation of TEI Lite as an example of the TEI modification mechanism, the
        opportunity was taken to produce a lightly revised XML-conformant version. In 2006, a more
        substantially revised version based on TEI P5 was produced; this reflected the many changes
        between TEI P4 and TEI P5, but was not otherwise significantly different. In 2012, the TEI
        Technical Council, decided that a final revision should be undertaken to ensure that the
        documentation remained consistent with the latest (2.1) release of TEI P5. This version uses a
        recently added mechanism in the TEI customization architecture, which permits a customization
        to define only the TEI elements to be included in a schema, rather than the elements to be
        excluded from it. As such it is probably more resilient to change than earlier versions. </p>

      <p>This document provides an introduction to the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative
      (TEI), by describing a specific subset of the full TEI encoding scheme. The scheme documented
      here can be used to encode a wide variety of commonly encountered textual features, in such a
      way as to maximize the usability of electronic transcriptions and to facilitate their
      interchange among scholars using different computer systems. It is fully compatible with the
      full TEI scheme, as defined by TEI document P5, <title>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding
      and Interchange</title>, as of February 2006, and available from the TEI Consortium website at
      <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/"/>. </p>
      <div xml:id="U5-Intro">
        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines are addressed to anyone who wants to
        interchange information stored in an electronic form. They emphasize the interchange of textual
        information, but other forms of information such as images and sound are also addressed. The
        Guidelines are equally applicable in the creation of new resources and in the interchange of
        existing ones.</p>
        <p>The Guidelines provide a means of making explicit certain features of a text in such a way as
        to aid the processing of that text by computer software running on different machines. This
        process of making explicit we call <term>markup</term> or <term>encoding</term>. Any textual
        representation on a computer uses some form of markup; the TEI came into being partly because
        of the enormous variety of mutually incomprehensible encoding schemes currently besetting
        scholarship, and partly because of the expanding range of scholarly uses now being identified
        for texts in electronic form.</p>
        <p>The TEI Guidelines describe an encoding scheme which can be expressed using a number of
        different formal languages. The first editions of the Guidelines used the <term>Standard
        Generalized Markup Language</term> (SGML); since 2002, this has been replaced by the use of
        the Extensible Markup Language (XML). These markup languages have in common the definition of
        text in terms of <term>elements</term> and <term>attributes</term>, and rules governing their
        appearance within a text. The TEI's use of XML is ambitious in its complexity and generality,
        but it is fundamentally no different from that of any other XML markup scheme, and so any
        general-purpose XML-aware software is able to process TEI-conformant texts.</p>
        <p>Since 2001, the TEI has been a community initiative supported by an international membership
        consortium. It was originally an international research project sponsored by the Association
        for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the
        Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, with substantial funding over its first five
        years from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities, Directorate General XIII of the
        Commission of the European Communities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Social Science and
        Humanities Research Council of Canada and others. The Guidelines were first published in May
        1994, after six years of development involving many hundreds of scholars from different
        academic disciplines worldwide. During the years that followed, the Guidelines became
        increasingly influential in the development of the digital library, in the language industries,
        and even in the development of the World Wide Web itself. The TEI Consortium was set up in
        January 2001, and a year later produced an edition of the Guidelines entirely revised for XML
        compatibility. In 2004, it set about a major revision of the Guidelines to take full advantage
        of new schema languages, the first release of which appeared in 2005. This revision of the TEI
        Lite document conforms to version 2.1 of this most recent edition of the Guidelines, TEI P5,
        released in June 2012.</p>
        <p>At the outset of its work, the overall goals of the TEI were defined by the closing statement
        of a planning conference held at Vassar College, N.Y., in November, 1987; these
        <soCalled>Poughkeepsie Principles</soCalled> were further elaborated in a series of design
        documents. The Guidelines, say these design documents, should: <list>
        <item>suffice to represent the textual features needed for research;</item>
        <item>be simple, clear, and concrete;</item>
        <item>be easy for researchers to use without special-purpose software;</item>
        <item>allow the rigorous definition and efficient processing of texts;</item>
        <item>provide for user-defined extensions;</item>
        <item>conform to existing and emergent standards.</item>
      </list>
        </p>
        <p>The world of scholarship is large and diverse. For the Guidelines to have wide acceptability,
        it was important to ensure that: <list type="ordered">
        <item>the common core of textual features be easily shared;</item>
        <item>additional specialist features be easy to add to (or remove from) a text;</item>
        <item>multiple parallel encodings of the same feature should be possible;</item>
        <item>the richness of markup should be user-defined, with a very small minimal
        requirement;</item>
        <item>adequate documentation of the text and its encoding should be provided.</item>
      </list>
        </p>
        <p>The present document describes a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements and
        recommendations resulting from those design goals, which is called <title>TEI Lite</title>.</p>
        <p>In selecting from the several hundred elements defined by the full TEI scheme, we have tried
        to identify a useful <soCalled>starter set</soCalled>, comprising the elements which almost
        every user should know about. Experience working with TEI Lite will be invaluable in
        understanding the full TEI scheme and in knowing how to integrate specialized parts of it into
        the general TEI framework.</p>
        <p>Our goals in defining this subset may be summarized as follows: <list type="simple">
        <item>it should be able to handle adequately a reasonably wide variety of texts, at the level
        of detail found in existing practice (as demonstrated in, for example, the holdings of the
        Oxford Text Archive);</item>
        <item>it should be useful for the production of new documents (such as this one) as well as
        the encoding of existing texts;</item>
        <item>it should be usable with a wide range of existing XML software;</item>
        <item>it should be a pure subset of the full TEI scheme and defined using the customizaticon
        methods described in the TEI Guidelines;</item>
        <item>it should be as small and simple as is consistent with the other goals.</item>
        </list> The reader may judge our success in meeting these goals for him or herself.</p>
        <p>Although we have tried to make this document self-contained, as suits a tutorial text, the
        reader should be aware that it does not cover every detail of the TEI encoding scheme. All of
        the elements described here are fully documented in the TEI Guidelines themselves, which should
        be consulted for authoritative reference information on these, and on the many others which are
        not described here. Some basic knowledge of XML is assumed.</p>

        <head>A Short Example</head>
        <p>We begin with a short example, intended to show what happens when a passage of prose is typed
        into a computer by someone with little sense of the purpose of mark-up, or the potential of
        electronic texts. In an ideal world, such output might be generated by a very accurate optical
        scanner. It attempts to be faithful to the appearance of the printed text, by retaining the
        original line breaks, by introducing blanks to represent the layout of the original headings
        and page breaks, and so forth. Where characters not available on the keyboard are needed (such
        as the accented letter <mentioned>a</mentioned> in <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> or the long
        dash), it attempts to mimic their appearance.</p>

            CHAPTER 38
            
            READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-
            son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I
            went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
            the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
            'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
            housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic
            order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a
            remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having
            one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned
            by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did
            stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
            roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
            and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
            polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --
            'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'
            A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,
            but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she
            basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to
            ear.
            'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-
            ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he
            was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian
            name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
            would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
            wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.
            'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary
            this.'
            I put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear
            more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time
            after, I caught the words --
            'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And
            again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
            good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
            that.'
            I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what
            I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and
            
            474
            
            JANE EYRE                      475
            
            Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she
            would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she
            would come and see me.
            'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I
            read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-
            moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
            grave or mine.'
            How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
            the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
            to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
            ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,
            kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-
            ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who
            live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

        <p>This transcription suffers from a number of shortcomings: <list>
        <item>the page numbers and running titles are intermingled with the text in a way which makes
        it difficult for software to disentangle them;</item>
        <item>no distinction is made between single quotation marks and apostrophe, so it is difficult
        to know exactly which passages are in direct speech;</item>
        <item>the preservation of the copy text's hyphenation means that simple-minded search programs
        will not find the broken words;</item>
        <item>the accented letter in <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> and the long dash have been rendered
        by ad hoc keying conventions which follow no standard pattern and will be processed correctly
        only if the transcriber remembers to mention them in the documentation;</item>
        <item>paragraph divisions are marked only by the use of white space, and hard carriage returns
        have been introduced at the end of each line. Consequently, if the size of type used to print
        the text changes, reformatting will be problematic.</item>
      </list>
        </p>
        <p>We now present the same passage, as it might be encoded using the TEI Guidelines. As we shall
        see, there are many ways in which this encoding could be extended, but as a minimum, the TEI
        approach allows us to represent the following distinctions: <list>
        <item>Paragraph and chapter divisions are now marked explicitly.</item>
        <item>Apostrophes are distinguished from quotation marks; direct speech is explicitly
        marked.</item>
        <item>The accented letter and the long dash are correctly represented.</item>
        <item>Page divisions have been marked with an empty <gi>pb</gi> element alone.</item>
        <item>The lineation of the original has not been retained and words broken by typographic
        accident at the end of a line have been re-assembled without comment.</item>
        <item>For convenience of proof reading, a new line has been introduced at the start of each
        paragraph, but the indentation is removed.</item>

          <p>Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone
          present. When we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where
          Mary was cooking the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said —</p>
          <p>
            <q>Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.</q> The housekeeper and her
            husband were of that decent, phlegmatic order of people, to whom one may at any time safely
            communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears
            pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
            wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting
            a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
            and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the polishing process; but
          Mary, bending again over the roast, said only —</p>
          <p>
            <q>Have you, miss? Well, for sure!</q>
          </p>
          <p>A short time after she pursued, <q>I seed you go out with the master, but I didn't know
          you were gone to church to be wed</q>; and she basted away. John, when I turned to him, was
          grinning from ear to ear. <q>I telled Mary how it would be,</q> he said: <q>I knew what Mr
          Edward</q> (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
          house, therefore he often gave him his Christian name) — <q>I knew what Mr Edward would do;
          and I was certain he would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
          wish you joy, miss!</q> and he politely pulled his forelock.</p>
          <p>
            <q>Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.</q>
          </p>
          <p>I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen.
          In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the words —</p>
          <p>
            <q>She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.</q> And again, <q>If she
            ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faàl, and varry good-natured; and i' his een she's
            fair beautiful, onybody may see that.</q>
          </p>
          <p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully
          explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and <pb n="475"/> Mary approved the step
          unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just give me time to get over the honeymoon,
          and then she would come and see me.</p>
          <p>
            <q>She had better not wait till then, Jane,</q> said Mr Rochester, when I read her letter
            to him; <q>if she does, she will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our life long:
            its beams will only fade over your grave or mine.</q>
          </p>
          <p>How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered the letter in which I
          communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me, without, however, mentioning Mr
          Rochester's name or alluding to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very
          serious, kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspondence ever
          since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world,
          and only mind earthly things.</p>

    <p>This particular encoding represents a set of choices or priorities. As a trivial example,
    note that in the second example, end-of-line hyphenation has been silently removed. Conceivably
    Brontë (or her printer) intended the word <q>honeymoon</q> to appear as <q>honey-moon</q> on
    its second appearance, though this seems unlikely: our decision to focus on Brontë's text,
    rather than on the printing of it in this particular edition, makes it impossible to be
    certain. This is an instance of the fundamental <emph>selectivity</emph> of any encoding. An
    encoding makes explicit only those textual features of importance to the encoder. It is not
    difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this short passage might readily be
    extended. For example: <list type="simple">
    <item>a regularized form of the passages in dialect could be provided; </item>
    <item>footnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be added;</item>
    <item>pointers linking parts of this text to others could be added;</item>
    <item>proper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the surrounding text;</item>
    <item>detailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance and context could be
    prefixed to it;</item>
    <item>a linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses, words, etc., could be
    provided, each unit being associated with appropriate category codes;</item>
    <item>the text could be segmented into narrative or discourse units;</item>
    <item>systematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be included in the encoding,
    with potentially complex alignment or linkage between the text and the analysis, or between
    the text and one or more translations of it;</item>
    <item>passages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on other media.</item>
  </list>
    </p>
    <p>TEI-recommended ways of carrying out most of these are described in the remainder of this
    document. The TEI scheme as a whole also provides for an enormous range of other possibilities,
    of which we cite only a few: <list type="simple">
    <item>detailed analysis of the components of names;</item>
    <item>detailed meta-information providing thesaurus-style information about the text's origins
    or topics;</item>
    <item>information about the printing history or manuscript variations exhibited by a
    particular series of versions of the text.</item>
    </list> For recommendations on these and many other possibilities, the full Guidelines should
    be consulted.</p>

  <div xml:id="U5-struc">
    <head>The Structure of a TEI Text</head>
    <p>All TEI-conformant texts contain (a) a <term>TEI header</term> (marked up as a
    <gi>teiHeader</gi> element) and (b) the transcription of the text proper (marked up as a
    <gi>text</gi> element). These two elements are combined together to form a single <gi>TEI</gi>
    element, which must be declared within the TEI namespace<note place="foot">A
    <term>namespace</term> is an XML concept. Its function is to identify the vocabulary from
    which a group of element names are drawn, using a standard identifier resembling a web
    address. The namespace for all TEI elements is
    <code>http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0</code>
    </note>. </p>
    <p>The TEI header provides information analogous to that provided by the title page of a printed
    text. It has up to four parts: a bibliographic description of the machine-readable text, a
    description of the way it has been encoded, a non-bibliographic description of the text (a
    <term>text profile</term>), and a revision history. The header is described in more detail in
    section <ptr target="#U5-header"/>.</p>
    <p>A TEI text may be <term>unitary</term> (a single work) or <term>composite</term> (a
    collection of single works, such as an anthology). In either case, the text may have an
    optional <term>front</term> or <term>back</term>. In between is the <term>body</term> of the
    text, which, in the case of a composite text, may consist of <term>group</term>s, each
    containing more groups or texts.</p>
    <p>A unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <TEI>
      <teiHeader><!-- [ TEI Header information ]  --></teiHeader>
      <text>
        <front><!-- [ front matter ... ] -->
        </front>
        <body>
          <!-- [ body of text ... ]  -->
        </body>
        <back><!--  [ back matter ...  ] -->
        </back>
      </text>
    </TEI>
  </egXML>
    </p>
    <p>A composite text also has an optional front and back. In between occur one or more groups of
    texts, each with its own optional front and back matter. A composite text will thus be encoded
    using an overall structure like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <TEI>
      <teiHeader>
        <!--[ header information for the composite ]-->
      </teiHeader>
      <text>
        <front>
          <!--[ front matter for the composite  ]-->
        </front>
        <group>
          <text>
            <front>
              <!--[ front matter of first text ]-->
            </front>
            <body>
              <!--[ body of first text  ]-->
            </body>
            <back>
              <!--[ back matter of first text ]-->
            </back>
          </text>
          <text>
            <front>
              <!--[ front matter of second text]-->
            </front>
            <body>
              <!--[ body of second text  ]-->
            </body>
            <back>
              <!--[ back matter of second text ]-->
            </back>
          </text>
          <!--[ more texts or groups of texts here ]-->
        </group>
        <back>
          <!--[ back matter for the composite  ]-->
        </back>
      </text>
    </TEI>
  </egXML>
    </p>
    <p>It is also possible to define a composite of complete TEI texts, each with its own header.
    Such a collection is known as a <term>TEI corpus</term>, and may itself have a header: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <teiCorpus>
      <teiHeader>
        <!--[header information for the corpus]-->
      </teiHeader>
      <TEI>
        <teiHeader><!--[header information for first text]--></teiHeader>
        <text>
          <!--[first text in corpus]-->
        </text>
      </TEI>
      <TEI>
        <teiHeader><!--[header information for second text]--></teiHeader>
        <text>
          <!--[second text in corpus]-->
        </text>
      </TEI>
    </teiCorpus>
    </egXML> It is also possible to create a composite of corpora -- that is,
    one <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element may contain many nested <gi>teiCorpus</gi> elements rather than
    many nested <gi>TEI</gi> elements, to any depth considered necessary.</p>
    <p>In the remainder of this document, we discuss chiefly simple text structures. The discussion
    in each case consists of a short list of relevant TEI <term>elements</term> with a brief
    definition of each, followed by definitions for any <term>attributes</term> specific to that
    element, and a reference to any <term>classes</term> of which the element is a member. These
    references are linked to full specifications for each object, as given in the TEI
    <title>Guidelines</title>. In most cases, short examples are also given.</p>
    <p>For example, here are the elements discussed so far: <specList>
    <specDesc key="TEI"/>
    <specDesc key="teiHeader"/>
    <specDesc key="text"/>
    <specDesc key="teiCorpus"/>
  </specList>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div xml:id="U5-body">
    <head>Encoding the Body</head>
    <p>As indicated above, a simple TEI document at the textual level consists of the following
    elements: <specList>
    <specDesc key="front"/>
    <specDesc key="group"/>
    <specDesc key="body"/>
    <specDesc key="back"/>
    </specList> Elements specific to front and back matter are described below in section <ptr target="#U5-fronbac"/>. In this section we discuss the elements making up the body of a text. </p>
    <div xml:id="divs">
      <head>Text Division Elements</head>
      <p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs, or these paragraphs may be
      grouped together into chapters, sections, subsections, etc. Each paragraph is tagged using the
      <gi>p</gi> tag. The <gi>div</gi> element is used to represent any such grouping of
      paragraphs. <specList>
      <specDesc key="p"/>
      <specDesc key="div"/>
    </specList>
      </p>
      <p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>div</gi> element may be used to supply a
      conventional name for this category of text division, or otherwise distinguish them. Typical
      values might be <q>book</q>, <q>chapter</q>, <q>section</q>, <q>part</q>, <q>poem</q>,
      <q>song</q>, etc. For a given project, it will usually be advisable to define and adhere to a
      specific list of such values. </p>
      <p>A <gi>div</gi> element may itself contain further, nested, <gi>div</gi>s, thus mimicking the
      traditional structure of a book, which can be decomposed hierarchically into units such as
      parts, containing chapters, containing sections, and so on. TEI texts in general conform to
      this simple hierarchic model.</p>
      <p> The <att>xml:id</att> attribute may be used to supply a unique identifier for the division,
      which may be used for cross references or other links to it, such as a commentary, as further
      discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>. It is often useful to provide an
      <att>xml:id</att> attribute for every major structural unit in a text, and to derive its
      values in some systematic way, for example by appending a section number to a short code for
      the title of the work in question, as in the examples below. It is particularly useful to
      supply such identifiers if the resource concerned is to be made available over the web, since
      they make it much easier for other web-based applications to link directly to the
      corresponding parts of your text. </p>
      <p>The <att>n</att> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or alternatively) a short
      mnemonic name or number for a division, or any other element. If a conventional form of
      reference or abbreviation for the parts of a work already exists (such as the
      book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical citations), the <att>n</att> attribute is the place to
      record it; unlike the identifier supplied by <att>xml:id</att>, it does not need to be
      unique.</p>
      <p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be used to specify the language of the division.
      Languages are identified by an internationally defined code, as further discussed in section
      <ptr target="#z636"/> below.</p>
      <p>The <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to supply information about the rendition
      (appearance) of a division, or any other element, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-hilites"/> below. As with the <att>type</att> attribute, a project will often
      find it useful to predefine the possible values for this attribute, but TEI Lite does not
      constrain it in anyway. </p>
      <p> These four attributes, <att>xml:id</att>, <att>n</att>, <att>xml:lang</att>, and
      <att>rend</att> are so widely useful that they are allowed on any element in any TEI schema:
      they are <term>global attributes</term>. Other global attributes defined in the TEI Lite
      scheme are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
      <p>The value of every <att>xml:id</att> attribute should be unique within a document. One
      simple way of ensuring that this is so is to make it reflect the hierarchic structure of the
      document. For example, Smith's <title>Wealth of Nations</title> as first published consists of
      five books, each of which is divided into chapters, while some chapters are further subdivided
      into parts. We might define <att>xml:id</att> values for this structure as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <body>
        <div xml:id="WN1" n="I" type="book">
          <div xml:id="WN101" n="I.1" type="chapter">
            <!-- ... -->
          </div>
          <div xml:id="WN102" n="I.2" type="chapter">
            <!-- ... -->
          </div>
          <!-- ... -->
          <div xml:id="WN110" n="I.10" type="chapter">
            <div xml:id="WN1101" n="I.10.1" type="part">
              <!-- ... -->
            </div>
            <div xml:id="WN1102" n="I.10.2" type="part">
              <!-- ... -->
            </div>
          </div>
          <!-- ... -->
        </div>
        <div xml:id="WN2" n="II" type="book">
          <!-- ... -->
        </div>
      </body>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <att>xml:id</att> and <att>n</att> attributes:
      this is often useful where a canonical reference scheme is used which does not tally with the
      structure of the work. For example, in a novel divided into books each containing chapters,
      where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the whole work, rather than within each
      book, one might use a scheme such as the following: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <body>
        <div xml:id="TS01" n="1" type="volume">
          <div xml:id="TS011" n="1" type="chapter">
            <!-- ... -->
          </div>
          <div xml:id="TS012" n="2" type="chapter">
          <!-- ... --></div>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="TS02" n="2" type="volume">
          <div xml:id="TS021" n="3" type="chapter">
          <!-- ... --></div>
          <div xml:id="TS022" n="4" type="chapter">
          <!-- ... --></div>
        </div>
      </body>
      </egXML> Here the work has two volumes, each containing two chapters. The chapters are
      numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the <att>xml:id</att> values specified allow them to be
      regarded additionally as if they were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="h25">
      <head>Headings and Closings</head>
      <p>Every <gi>div</gi> may have a title or heading at its start, and (less commonly) a trailer
      such as <q>End of Chapter 1</q> at its end. The following elements may be used to transcribe
      them: <specList>
      <specDesc key="head"/>
      <specDesc key="trailer"/>
      </specList> Some other elements which may be necessary at the beginning or ending of text
      divisions are discussed below in section <ptr target="#h52"/>.</p>
      <p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a transcription is a matter for the
      individual transcriber to decide. Where a heading is completely regular (for example
      <q>Chapter 1</q>) or may be automatically constructed from attribute values (e.g.
      <code>&lt;div type="chapter" n="1"&gt;</code>), it may be omitted; where it contains
      otherwise unrecoverable text it should always be included. For example, the start of Hardy's
      <title>Under the Greenwood Tree</title> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <div xml:id="UGT1" n="Winter" type="Part">
        <div xml:id="UGT11" n="1" type="Chapter">
          <head>Mellstock-Lane</head>
          <p>To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree ... </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </egXML>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="vedr">
      <head>Prose, Verse and Drama</head>
      <p>As in the Bronte example above, the paragraphs making up a textual division are tagged with
      the <gi>p</gi> tag. In poetic or dramatic texts different tags are needed, to represent verse
      lines and stanzas in the first case, or individual speeches and stage directions in the
      second. : <specList>
      <specDesc key="l"/>
      <specDesc key="lg"/>
      <specDesc key="sp"/>
      <specDesc key="speaker"/>
      <specDesc key="stage"/>
    </specList>
      </p>
      <p>Here, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse lines and stanzas are
      tagged: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <lg n="I">
        <l>I Sing the progresse of a
        deathlesse soule,</l>
        <l>Whom Fate, with God made, but doth not controule,</l>
        <l>Plac'd in
        most shapes; all times before the law</l>
        <l>Yoak'd us, and when, and since, in this I

        <l>And the great world to his aged evening;</l>
        <l>From infant morne, through manly
        noone I draw.</l>
        <l>What the gold Chaldee, of silver Persian saw,</l>
        <l>Greeke brass, or

        <l>And (holy writs excepted) made to yeeld to none,</l>
      </lg>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>Note that the <gi>l</gi> element marks verse lines, not typographic lines: the original
      lineation of the first few lines above has not therefore been made explicit by this encoding,
      and may be lost. The <gi>lb</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#U5-pln"/> might
      additionally be used to mark typographic lines if so desired. </p>
      <p>Here is the end of a famous dramatic text, in which speeches and stage directions are
      marked: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        <speaker>Estragon</speaker>
        <p>You want me to pull off my trousers?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
        <speaker>Vladimir</speaker>
        <p>Pull <emph>on</emph> your trousers.</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

        <p>Yes, let's go.</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They do not move.</stage>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>Note that the <gi>stage</gi> (stage direction) element can appear either within a speech or
      between speeches. The <gi>sp</gi> ("speech") element contains, following an optional
      <gi>speaker</gi> element indicating who is speaking, either paragraphs (if the speech is in
      prose) or verse lines or stanzas as in the next example. In this case, it is quite common to
      find that verse lines are split between speakers. The easiest way of encoding this is to use
      the <att>part</att> attribute to indicate that the lines so fragmented are incomplete : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

      </p>
      <p>The same mechanism may be applied to stanzas which are divided between two speakers: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        <!-- ... -->
      </div>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>The <gi>sp</gi> element can also be used for dialogue presented in a prose work as if it
      were drama, as in the next example, which also demonstrates the use of the <att>who</att>
      attribute to bear a code identifying the speaker of the piece of dialogue concerned: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <div>
        <sp who="#OPI">

        <sp who="#OPI">

      </div>
      </egXML> Here the <att>who</att> attribute values (<code>#OPI</code> etc.) are links,

        <item xml:id="GRM">
          <name>Mr Gryll</name> : named for the mythical Gryllus, one of Ulysses'
          sailors transformed by Circe into a pig, who argues that he was happier in that state than
        as a man</item>

      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div xml:id="U5-pln">
    <head>Page and Line Numbers</head>
    <p>Page and line breaks etc. may be marked with the following elements. <specList>
    <specDesc key="pb"/>
    <specDesc key="lb"/>
    <specDesc key="milestone"/>
    </specList> These elements mark a single point in the text, not a span of text. The global
    <att>n</att> attribute should be used to supply the number of the page or line beginning at
    the tag. </p>
    <p>When working from a paginated original, it is often useful to record its pagination, if only
    to simplify later proof-reading. It is also useful for synchronizing an encoded text with a set
    of page images. Recording the line breaks may be useful for similar reasons.
    <!--; treatment of end-of-line
        hyphenation in printed source texts will require some consideration.--></p>
    <p>If features such as pagination or lineation are marked for more than one edition, specify the
    edition in question using the <att>ed</att> attribute, and supply as many tags are necessary.
    For example, in the following passage we indicate where the page breaks occur in two different
    editions (<val>ED1</val> and <val>ED2</val>) <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully
    explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and <pb ed="ED1" n="475"/> Mary approved the step
    unreservedly. Diana announced that she would <pb ed="ED2" n="485"/>just give me time to get
    over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.</p>
  </egXML>
    </p>
    <p>A special attribute <att>break</att> may be used to indicate whether or not this empty
    element is considered as a word-breaking, irrespective of any adjacent whitespace. For example,
    in the following encoded sample: </p>
    <p>The <gi>pb</gi> and <gi>lb</gi> elements are special cases of the general class of
    <term>milestone</term> elements which mark reference points within a text. The generic
    <gi>milestone</gi> element can mark any kind of reference point: for example, a column break,
    the start of a new kind of section not otherwise tagged, or in general any significant change
    in the text not marked by an XML element. The names used for types of unit and for editions
    referred to by the <att>ed</att> and <att>unit</att> attributes may be chosen freely, but
    should be documented in the header <gi>refsDecl</gi> element (see <ptr target="#refsdecl"/>).
    The <gi>milestone</gi> element may be used to replace the others, or the others may be used as
    a set; they should not be mixed arbitrarily.</p>
  </div>
  <div xml:id="U5-hilites">
    <head>Marking Highlighted Phrases</head>
    <div xml:id="faces">
      <head>Changes of Typeface, etc.</head>
      <p>Highlighted words or phrases are those made visibly different from the rest of the text,
      typically by a change of type font, handwriting style, ink colour etc., which is intended to
      draw the reader's attention to some associated change.</p>
      <p>The global <att>rend</att> attribute can be attached to any element, and used wherever
      necessary to specify details of the highlighting used for it in the source. For example, a
      heading rendered in bold might be tagged <code>&lt;head rend="bold"&gt;</code>, and one in
      italic <code>&lt;head rend="italic"&gt;</code>.</p>
      <p>The values to be used for the
      <att>rend</att> attribute are not specified by the TEI Guidelines, since they will depend
      entirely on the needs of the particular project. Some typical values might include
      <code>italic</code>, <code>bold</code> 
      <!--, <code>sup</code>(erior)--> etc. for font variations;
      <code>center</code>, <code>right</code> etc. for alignment; <code>large</code>,
      <code>small</code> etc. for size; <code>smallcaps</code>, <code>allcaps</code> etc. for type
      variants and so on. Several such words may be used in combination as necessary, but no formal
      syntax is proposed. The full TEI Guidelines provide more rigorous mechanisms, using other W3C
      standards such as CSS, as an alternative to the use of <att>rend</att>. </p>
      <p>It is not always possible or desirable to interpret the reasons for such changes of
      rendering in a text. In such cases, the element <gi>hi</gi> may be used to mark a sequence of
      highlighted text without making any claim as to its status. <specList>
      <specDesc key="hi"/>
    </specList>
      </p>
      <p>In the following example, the use of a distinct typeface for the subheading and for the
      included name are recorded but not interpreted: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <p>
        <hi rend="gothic">And this Indenture further
        witnesseth</hi> that the said <hi rend="italic">Walter Shandy</hi>, merchant, in
      consideration of the said intended marriage ...</p>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>Alternatively, where the cause for the highlighting can be identified with confidence, a
      number of other, more specific, elements are available. <specList>
      <specDesc key="emph"/>
      <specDesc key="foreign"/>
      <specDesc key="gloss"/>
      <specDesc key="label"/>
      <specDesc key="mentioned"/>
      <specDesc key="term"/>
      <specDesc key="title"/>
    </specList>
      </p>
      <p>Some features (notably quotations and glosses) may be found in a text either marked by
      highlighting, or with quotation marks. In either case, the elements <gi>q</gi> and
      <gi>gloss</gi> (as discussed in the following section) should be used. If the highlighting is
      to be recorded, use the global <att>rend</att> attribute.</p>
      <p>As an example of the elements defined here, consider the following sentence: <q rend="display">On the one hand the <hi rend="it">Nibelungenlied</hi> is associated with the
      new rise of romance of twelfth-century France, the <hi rend="it">romans d'antiquité</hi>, the
      romances of Chrétien de Troyes, and the German adaptations of these works by Heinrich van
      Veldeke, Hartmann von Aue, and Wolfram von Eschenbach.</q> Interpreting the role of the
      highlighting, the sentence might look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <p>On the one hand the <title>Nibelungenlied</title>
      is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France, the <foreign>romans
      d'antiquité</foreign>, the romances of Chrétien de Troyes, ...</p>
      </egXML> Describing only
      the appearance of the original, it might look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <p>On the one hand the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France,
      the <hi rend="italic">romans d'antiquité</hi>, the romances of Chrétien de Troyes,
      ...</p>
    </egXML>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="z635">
      <head>Quotations and Related Features</head>
      <p>Like changes of typeface, quotation marks are conventionally used to denote several
      different features within a text, of which the most frequent is quotation. When possible, we
      recommend that the underlying feature be tagged, rather than the simple fact that quotation
      marks appear in the text, using the following elements: <specList>
      <specDesc key="q"/>
      <!--specDesc key="quote"/-->
      <!--specDesc key="said"/-->
      <specDesc key="mentioned"/>
      <specDesc key="soCalled"/>
      <specDesc key="gloss"/>
    </specList>
      </p>
      <p>Here is a simple example of a quotation: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <p>Few dictionary makers are likely to forget Dr. Johnson's description of the
      lexicographer as <q>a harmless drudge.</q>
      </p>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>To record how a quotation was printed (for example, <term>in-line</term> or set off as a
      <term>display</term> or <term>block quotation</term>), the <att>rend</att> attribute should
      be used. This may also be used to indicate the kind of quotation marks used.</p>
      <p>Direct speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply by ending the quotation
      and beginning it again after the interruption, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <p>
        <q>Who-e debel you?</q> — he at last said —
        <q>you no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q> And so saying, the lighted tomahawk began
      flourishing about me in the dark.</p>
      </egXML> If it is important to convey the idea that the
      two <gi>q</gi> elements together make up a single speech, the linking attributes
      <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> may be used, as described in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
      <p>Quotations may be accompanied by a reference to the source or speaker, using the
      <att>who</att> attribute, whether or not this is explicit in the text, as in the following
      example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <q who="#Wilson">Spaulding, he came
      down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he
      says:—<q who="#Spaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed
      man.</q>
      </q>
      </egXML> This example also demonstrates how quotations may be embedded within
      other quotations: one speaker (Wilson) quotes another speaker (Spaulding).</p>
      <p>The creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation marks are replaced by the
      tags or whether the tags are added and the quotation marks kept. If the quotation marks are
      removed from the text, the <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to record the way in which
      they were rendered in the copy text.</p>
      <p>The full TEI Guidelines provide additional elements to distinguish direct speech,
      quotation, and other typical uses of quotation mark although it is not always possible and may
      not be considered desirable to interpret the function of quotation marks in a text. For
      simplicity, only <gi>q</gi> (which may be used for any such case) has been included in TEI
      Lite. </p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="z636">
      <head>Foreign Words or Expressions</head>
      <p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the texts may be tagged as such in
      one of two ways. If the word or phrase is already tagged for some reason, the element
      indicated should bear a value for the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute indicating the
      language used. Where there is no applicable element, the element <gi>foreign</gi> may be used,
      again using the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <p>John has real <foreign xml:lang="fr">savoir-faire</foreign>.</p>
      <p>Have you read <title xml:lang="de">Die
      Dreigroschenoper</title>?</p>
      <p>
        <mentioned xml:lang="fr">Savoir-faire</mentioned> is French
      for know-how.</p>
      <p>The court issued a writ of <term xml:lang="la">mandamus</term>.</p>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>As these examples show, the <gi>foreign</gi> element should not be used to tag foreign words
      if some other more specific element such as <gi>title</gi>, <gi>mentioned</gi>, or
      <gi>term</gi> applies. The global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be attached to any
      element to show that it uses some other language than that of the surrounding text.</p>
      <p>The codes used to identify languages, supplied on the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute, must be
      constructed in a particular way, and must conform to common Internet standards<note place="foot">The relevant standard is <title>Best Current Practice 47</title> (<ptr target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47"/>). The authoritative list of registered subtags

    <p>All notes, whether printed as footnotes, endnotes, marginalia, or elsewhere, should be marked

    <specDesc key="note"/>
    </specList> Where possible, the body of a note should be inserted in the text at the point at
    which its identifier or mark first appears. This may not be possible for example with
    marginalia, which may not be anchored to an exact location. For simplicity, it may be adequate
    to position marginal notes before the relevant paragraph or other element. Notes may also be
    placed in a separate division of the text (as end-notes are, in printed books) and linked to
    the relevant portion of the text using their <att>target</att> attribute.</p>
    <p>The <att>n</att> attribute may be used to supply the number or identifier of a note if this

      <p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12">section 12 on
      page 34</ref>.</egXML>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML>
      The value of the <att>target</att> attribute on either element may be the identifier of some
      other element within the current document. The passage or phrase being pointed at must bear an
      identifier, and must therefore be tagged as an element of some kind. In the following example,
      the cross reference is to a <gi>div</gi> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... see especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>. ... <div xml:id="SEC12">
      <head>Concerning Identifiers</head>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
  </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>Because the <att>xml:id</att> attribute is global, any element in a TEI document may be
      pointed to in this way. In the following example, a paragraph has been given an identifier so
      that it may be pointed at: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... this is
      discussed in <ref target="#pspec">the paragraph on links</ref> ... <p xml:id="pspec">Links
      may be made to any kind of element ...</p>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference does not correspond with any particular feature of
      a text, and so may not be tagged as an element of some kind. If the desired target is simply a
      point in the current document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an <gi>anchor</gi>
      element at the appropriate spot. If the target is some sequence of words not otherwise tagged,
      the <gi>seg</gi> element may be introduced to mark them. These two elements are described as
      follows: <specList>
      <specDesc key="anchor"/>
      <specDesc key="seg"/>
    </specList>
      </p>
      <p>In the following (imaginary) example, <gi>ref</gi> elements have been used to represent
      points in this text which are to be linked in some way to other parts of it; in the first case
      to a point, and in the second, to a sequence of words:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Returning to <ref target="#ABCD">the point where I
      dozed off</ref>, I noticed that <ref target="#EFGH">three words</ref> had been circled in
      red by a previous reader</egXML></p>
      <p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified identifiers (<code>ABCD</code> and
      <code>EFGH</code> in this example) are to be found somewhere else in the current document.
      Assuming that no element already exists to carry these identifiers, the <gi>anchor</gi> and
      <gi>seg</gi> elements may be used: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ....
      <anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> .... ....<seg type="target" xml:id="EFGH"> ...
      </seg> ...</egXML>
      </p>
      <p>The <att>type</att> attribute should be used (as above) to distinguish amongst different
      purposes for which these general purpose elements might be used in a text. Some other uses are
      discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> below.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="xptrs">
      <head>Pointing to other documents</head>
      <p>So far, we have shown how the elements <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> may be used for
      cross-references or links whose targets occur within the same document as their source.
      However, the same elements may also be used to refer to elements in any other XML document or
      resource, such as a document on the web, or a database component. This is possible because the
      value of the <att>target</att> attribute may be any valid <term>universal resource
      indicator</term> (URI)<note>A full definition of this term, defined by the W3C (the
      consortium which manages the development and maintenance of the World Wide Web), is beyond
      the scope of this tutorial: however, the most frequently encountered version of a URI is the
      familiar <soCalled>URL</soCalled> used to indicate a web page, such as
      <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>
      </note>. </p>
      <p>A URI may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example
      <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2</code>. The sharp sign indicates that what follows
      it is the identifier of an element to be located within the XML document identified by what
      precedes it: this example will therefore locate an element which has an <att>xml:id</att>
      attribute value of <val>SEC2</val> within the document retrieved from
      <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>. In the examples we have discussed so far, the
      part to the left of the sharp sign has been omitted: this is understood to mean that the
      referenced element is to be located within the current document.</p>
      <p>Parts of an XML document can be specified by means of other more sophisticated mechanisms
      using a special language called Xpath, also defined by the W3C. This is particularly useful
      where the elements to be linked to do not bear identifiers and must therefore be located by
      some other means.
      <!--A full specification of the language is well beyond
          the scope of this document; here we provide only a flavour of its power. </p>
          <p>In the XPath language, locations are defined as a series of <term>steps</term>, each one
          identifying some part of the document, often in terms of the locations identified by the
          previous step. For example, you would point to the third sentence of the second paragraph of
          chapter two by selecting chapter two in the first step, the second paragraph in the second
          step, and the third sentence in the last step. A step can be defined in terms of the document
          tree itself, using such concepts as <val>parent</val>, <val>descendent</val>,
          <val>preceding</val>, etc. or, more loosely, in terms of text patterns, word or character
          positions. --></p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="xatts">
      <head>Special kinds of Linking</head>
      <p>The following special purpose <term>linking</term> attributes are defined for every element
      in the TEI Lite scheme: <list type="gloss">
      <label>
        <att>ana</att>
      </label>
      <item>links an element with its interpretation.</item>
      <label>
        <att>corresp</att>
      </label>
      <item>links an element with one or more other corresponding elements.</item>
      <label>
        <att>next</att>
      </label>
      <item>links an element to the next element in an aggregate.</item>
      <label>
        <att>prev</att>
      </label>
      <item>links an element to the previous element in an aggregate.</item>
    </list>
      </p>
      <p>The <att>ana</att> (analysis) attribute is intended for use where a set of abstract analyses
      or interpretations have been defined somewhere within a document, as further discussed in
      section <ptr target="#U5-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis of the sentence <q>John
      loves Nancy</q> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <seg type="sentence" ana="SVO">
        <seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">John</seg>
        <seg type="lex" ana="#VVI">loves</seg>
        <seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">Nancy</seg>
      </seg>
      </egXML> This encoding
      implies the existence elsewhere in the document of elements with identifiers <val>SVO</val>,
      <val>NP1</val>, and <val>VV1</val> where the significance of these particular codes is
      explained. Note the use of the <gi>seg</gi> element to mark particular components of the
      analysis, distinguished by the <att>type</att> attribute.</p>
      <p>The <att>corresp</att> (corresponding) attribute provides a simple way of representing some
      form of correspondence between two elements in a text. For example, in a multilingual text, it
      may be used to link translation equivalents, as in the following example <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <seg xml:lang="fr" xml:id="FR1" corresp="#EN1">Jean
      aime Nancy</seg>
      <seg xml:lang="en" xml:id="EN1" corresp="#FR1">John loves
      Nancy</seg>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the following example, it has
      been used to represent the correspondences between <q rend="inline" type="inline">the
      show</q> and <q>Shirley</q>, and between <q>NBC</q> and <q>the network</q>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <p>
        <title xml:id="shirley">Shirley</title>, which
        made its Friday night debut only a month ago, was not listed on <name xml:id="nbc">NBC</name>'s new schedule, although <seg xml:id="network" corresp="#nbc">the network</seg>
        says <seg xml:id="show" corresp="#shirley">the show</seg> still is being
      considered.</p>
    </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>The <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> attributes provide a simple way of linking together
      the components of a discontinuous element, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
      <q xml:id="Q1a" next="#Q1b">Who-e debel you?</q> —
      he at last said — <q xml:id="Q1b" prev="#Q1a">you no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q> And so
      saying, the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.</egXML></p>

        <head>Editorial Interventions</head>
        <p>The process of encoding an electronic text has much in common with the process of editing a
        manuscript or other text for printed publication. In either case a conscientious editor may
        wish to record both the original state of the source and any editorial correction or other
        change made in it. The elements discussed in this and the next section provide some facilities
        for meeting these needs.</p>
        <div>
          <head>Correction and Normalization</head>
          <p>The following elements may be used to mark <term>correction</term>, that is editorial
          changes introduced where the editor believes the original to be erroneous: <specList>
          <specDesc key="corr"/>
          <specDesc key="sic"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>The following elements may be used to mark <term>normalization</term>, that is editorial
          changes introduced for the sake of consistency or modernization of a text: <specList>
          <specDesc key="orig"/>
          <specDesc key="reg"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>As an example, consider this extract from the quarto printing of Shakespeare's <title>Henry
          V</title>. <eg> ... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and a table of green feelds</eg>
          </p>
          <p>A modern editor might wish to make a number of interventions here, specifically to modernize
          (or normalise) the Elizabethan spellings of <mentioned>a'</mentioned> and
          <mentioned>feelds</mentioned> for <mentioned>he</mentioned> and <mentioned>fields</mentioned>
          respectively. He or she might also want to emend <mentioned>table</mentioned> to
          <mentioned>babbl'd</mentioned>, following an editorial tradition that goes back to the 18th
          century Shakespearian scholar Lewis Theobald. The following encoding would then be
          appropriate: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as sharp as
          a pen and <reg>he</reg>
          <corr resp="#Theobald">babbl'd</corr> of green <reg>fields</reg>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>A more conservative or source-oriented editor, however, might want to retain the original,
          but at the same time signal that some of the readings it contains are in some sense anomalous:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and
          <orig>a</orig>
          <sic>table</sic> of green <orig>feelds</orig>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>Finally, a modern digital editor may decide to combine both possibilities in a single
          composite text, using the <gi>choice</gi> element. <specList>
          <specDesc key="choice"/>
          </specList> This allows an editor to mark where alternative readings are possible: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and
          <choice>
            <orig>a</orig>

          </choice>
          <choice>
            <corr resp="#Theobald">babbl'd</corr>
            <sic>table</sic>
            </choice> of green
            <choice>
              <orig>feelds</orig>
              <reg>fields</reg>

        <div xml:id="U5-edit2">
          <head>Omissions, Deletions, and Additions</head>
          <p>In addition to correcting or normalizing words and phrases, editors and transcribers may
          also supply missing material, omit material, or transcribe material deleted or crossed out in
          the source. In addition, some material may be particularly hard to transcribe because it is
          hard to make out on the page. The following elements may be used to record such phenomena: <specList>
          <specDesc key="add"/>
          <specDesc key="gap"/>
          <specDesc key="del"/>
          <specDesc key="unclear"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>These elements may be used to record changes made by an editor, by the transcriber, or (in
          manuscript material) by the author or scribe. For example, if the source for an electronic
          text read <q>The following elements are provided for for simple editorial interventions.</q>
          then it might be felt desirable to correct the obvious error, but at the same time to record
          the deletion of the superfluous second <mentioned>for</mentioned>, thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements are provided for <del resp="#LB">for</del> simple editorial interventions.</egXML> The attribute value
          <code>#LB</code> on the <att>resp</att> attribute is used to point to a fuller definition
          (typically in a <gi>respStmt</gi> element) for the agency responsible for correcting the
          duplication of <mentioned>for</mentioned>.</p>
          <p>If the source read <q>The following elements provided for simple editorial
          interventions.</q> (i.e. if the verb had been inadvertently dropped) then the corrected text
          might read: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements <add resp="#LB">are</add> provided for simple editorial interventions.</egXML>
          </p>
          <p>These elements are also used to record
          authorial changes in manuscripts. A manuscript in which the author has first written <q>How it
          galls me, what a galling shadow</q>, then crossed out the word <mentioned>galls</mentioned>
          and inserted <mentioned>dogs</mentioned> might be encoded thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">How it <del hand="#DHL" type="overstrike">galls</del>
          <add hand="#DHL" place="supralinear">dogs</add> me, what a galling shadow</egXML> Again, the
          code <code>#DHL</code> points to another location where more information about the hand
          concerned is to be found<note place="foot">The full TEI provides a range of elements for
          encoding metadata about manuscript production and description, which are not however included
          in TEI Lite</note>. </p>
          <p>Similarly, the <gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>gap</gi> elements may be used together to indicate
          the omission of illegible material; the following example also shows the use of <gi>add</gi>
          for a conjectural emendation: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">One hundred
          &amp; twenty good regulars joined to me <unclear>
          <gap reason="indecipherable"/>

        &amp; instantly, would aid me signally <add hand="#ed">in?</add> an enterprise against
        Wilmington.</egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>del</gi> element marks material which has been transcribed as part of the electronic text
          despite being marked as deleted, while <gi>gap</gi> marks the location of material which is
          omitted from the electronic text, whether it is legible or not. A language corpus, for
          example, might omit long quotations in foreign languages: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <p> ... An example of a list appearing in a fief
          ledger of <name type="place">Koldinghus</name>

        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>Other corpora (particular those constructed before the widespread use of scanners)
          systematically omit figures and mathematics: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <p>At the bottom of your screen below the mode line is the <term>minibuffer</term>. This is
          the area where Emacs echoes the commands you enter and where you specify filenames for Emacs

          <p>The full TEI scheme provides more precise ways of capturing
          different aspects of  a transcription, distinguishing for example
          between text added or supplied by the encoder and text indicated as
          supplied or deleted in the source. TEI Lite does not provide different
          tags for these purposes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Abbreviations and their Expansion</head>
          <p>Like names, dates, and numbers, abbreviations may be transcribed as they stand or expanded;
          they may be left unmarked, or encoded using the following elements: <specList>
          <specDesc key="abbr"/>
          <specDesc key="expan"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>abbr</gi> element is useful as a means of distinguishing semi-lexical items such as
          acronyms or jargon: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">We can sum up the above
          discussion as follows: the identity of a <abbr>CC</abbr> is defined by that calibration of
          values which motivates the elements of its <abbr>GSP</abbr>;</egXML>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Every manufacturer of <abbr>3GL</abbr> or
          <abbr>4GL</abbr> languages is currently nailing on <abbr>OOP</abbr> extensions</egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish types of abbreviation by their
          function. </p>
          <p>The <gi>expan</gi> element is used to mark an expansion supplied by an encoder. This element
          is particularly useful in the transcription of manuscript materials. For example, the
          character p with a bar through its descender as a conventional representation for the word
          <val>per</val> is commonly encountered in Medieval European manuscripts. An encoder may
          choose to expand this as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <expan>per</expan>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The expansion corresponding with an abbreviated form may not always contain the same letters
          as the abbreviation. Where it does, however, common editorial practice is to italicize or
          otherwise signal which letters have been supplied. The <gi>expan</gi> element should not be
          used for this purpose since its function is to indicate an expanded form, not a part of one.
          For example, consider the common abbreviation <val>wt</val> (for <val>with</val>) found in
          medieval texts. In a modern edition, an editor might wish to represent this as <soCalled>w<hi rend="it">i</hi>t<hi rend="it">h</hi>
          </soCalled>, italicising the letters not found in the
          source. One simple means of achieving that would be an encoding such as the follow<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <expan>w<hi rend="it">i</hi>t<hi rend="it">h</hi>
          </expan>
        </egXML>
        The full TEI also provides elements <gi>ex</gi> and <gi>am</gi>
        for use in this situation, but these are not included in the TEI Lite
          schema.</p>
          <p>To record both an abbreviation and its expansion, the <gi>choice</gi> element mentioned
          above may be used to group the abbreviated form with its proposed expansion: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <choice>
            <abbr>wt</abbr>
            <expan>with</expan>
          </choice>
        </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="U5-names">
        <head>Names, Dates, and Numbers</head>
        <p>The TEI scheme defines elements for a large number of <soCalled>data-like</soCalled> features
        which may appear almost anywhere within almost any kind of text. These features may be of
        particular interest in a range of disciplines; they all relate to objects external to the text
        itself, such as the names of persons and places, numbers and dates. They also pose particular
        problems for many natural language processing (NLP) applications because of the variety of ways
        in which they may be presented within a text. The elements described here, by making such
        features explicit, reduce the complexity of processing texts containing them.</p>
        <div xml:id="nomen">
          <head>Names and Referring Strings</head>
          <p>A <term>referring string</term> is a phrase which refers to some person, place, object, etc.
          Two elements are provided to mark such strings: <specList>
          <specDesc key="rs"/>
          <specDesc key="name"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p> The <att>type</att> attribute is used to distinguish amongst (for example) names of
          persons, places and organizations, where this is possible: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs>, </q>
          said his lady to him one day, <q>have you heard that <rs type="place">Netherfield Park</rs>
          is let at last?</q>
        </egXML>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">It being one of the principles of the <rs type="organization">Circumlocution Office</rs> never, on any account whatsoever, to give a
        straightforward answer, <rs type="person">Mr Barnacle</rs> said, <q>Possibly.</q>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>As the following example shows, the <gi>rs</gi> element may be used for any reference to a
          person, place, etc, not necessarily one in the form of a proper noun or noun phrase. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs>,</q>
          said <rs type="person">his lady</rs> to him one day...</egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>name</gi> element by contrast is provided for the special case of referencing
          strings which consist only of proper nouns; it may be used synonymously with the <gi>rs</gi>
          element, or nested within it if a referring string contains a mixture of common and proper
          nouns.</p>
          <p>Simply tagging something as a name is rarely enough to enable automatic processing of
          personal names into the canonical forms usually required for reference purposes. The name as
          it appears in the text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague. Moreover, name
          prefixes such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de la</mentioned>, may or may not be
          included as part of the reference form of a name, depending on the language and country of
          origin of the bearer.</p>
          <p>The <att>key</att> attribute provides an alternative normalized identifier for the object
          being named, like a database record key. It may thus be useful as a means of gathering
          together all references to the same individual or location scattered throughout a document:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <q>My dear <rs type="person" key="BENM1">Mr.
            Bennet</rs>, </q> said <rs type="person" key="BENM2">his lady</rs> to him one day, <q>have
            you heard that <rs type="place" key="NETP1">Netherfield Park</rs> is let at
            last?</q>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>This use should be distinguished from the case of the <gi>reg</gi> (regularization) element,
          which provides a means of marking the standard form of a referencing string as demonstrated
          below: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <name type="person" key="WADLM1">
            <choice>
              <sic>Walter de la Mare</sic>
              <reg>de la Mare, Walter</reg>
            </choice>
            </name> was
            born at <name key="Ch1" type="place">Charlton</name>, in <name key="KT1" type="county">Kent</name>, in 1873.</egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>index</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="indexing"/> may be more appropriate if
          the function of the regularization is to provide a consistent index: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <p>
            <name type="place">Montaillou</name> is not a
            large parish. At the time of the events which led to <name type="person">Fournier</name>'s
            <index>
              <term>Benedict XII, Pope of Avignon (Jacques Fournier)</term>
            </index>
            investigations, the local population consisted of between 200 and 250
          inhabitants.</p>
          </egXML> Although adequate for many simple applications, these methods have
          two inconveniences: if the name occurs many times, then its regularised form must be repeated
          many times; and the burden of additional XML markup in the body of the text may be
          inconvenient to maintain and complex to process. For applications such as onomastics, relating
          to persons or places named rather than the name itself, or wherever a detailed analysis of the
          component parts of a name is needed, the full TEI Guidelines provide a range of other
          solutions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Dates and Times</head>
          <p>Tags for the more detailed encoding of times and dates include the following: <specList>
          <specDesc key="date"/>
          <specDesc key="time"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>These elements have a number of attributes which can be used to provide normalised versions
          of their values. <specList>
          <specDesc key="att.datable" atts="period when"/>
          </specList> The <att>when</att>
          attribute specifies a normalized form for the date or time, using one of the standard formats
          defined by ISO 8601. Partial dates or times (e.g. <q>1990</q>, <q>September 1990</q>,
          <q>twelvish</q>) can be expressed by omitting a part of the value supplied, as in the
          following examples: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <date when="1980-02-21">21
          Feb 1980</date>
          <date when="1990">1990</date>
          <date when="1990-09">September 1990</date>
          <date when="--09">September</date>
          <date when="2001-09-11T12:48:00">Sept 11th, 12 minutes before 9
          am</date>
          </egXML>Note in the last example the use of a normalized representation for the
          date string which includes a time: this example could thus equally well be tagged using the
          <gi>time</gi> element. </p>
          <p>

          <head>Numbers </head>
          <p>Numbers can be written with either letters or digits (<code>twenty-one</code>,
          <code>xxi</code>, and <code>21</code>) and their presentation is language-dependent (e.g.
          English <mentioned>5th</mentioned> becomes Greek <mentioned>5.</mentioned>; English
          <mentioned>123,456.78</mentioned> equals French <mentioned>123.456,78</mentioned>). In
          natural-language processing or machine-translation applications, it is often helpful to
          distinguish them from other, more <soCalled>lexical</soCalled> parts of the text. In other
          applications, the ability to record a number's value in standard notation is important. The
          <gi>num</gi> element provides this possibility: <specList>
          <specDesc key="num"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <num value="33">xxxiii</num>
          <num type="cardinal" value="21">twenty-one</num>
          <num type="percentage" value="10">ten percent</num>
          <num type="percentage" value="10">10%</num>

      <div xml:id="U5-lists">
        <head>Lists</head>
        <p>The element <gi>list</gi> is used to mark any kind of <term>list</term>. A list is a sequence
        of text items, which may be numbered, bulleted, or arranged as a glossary list. Each item may be preceded
        by an item label (in a glossary list, this label is the term being defined): <specList>
        <specDesc key="list"/>
        <specDesc key="item"/>
        <specDesc key="label"/>
      </specList>
        </p>
        <p>Individual list items are tagged with <gi>item</gi>. The first <gi>item</gi> may optionally
        be preceded by a <gi>head</gi>, which gives a heading for the list. The numbering of a list may
        be omitted, indicated using the <att>n</att> attribute on each item, or (rarely) tagged as
        content using the <gi>label</gi> element. The following are all thus equivalent: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <list>
          <head>A short list</head>
          <item>First item in list.</item>

          <item>Third item in list.</item>
        </list>
        </egXML> The styles should not be mixed in the same list.</p>
        <p>A simple two-column table may be treated as a <term>glossary list</term>, tagged
        <code>&lt;list type="gloss"&gt;</code>. Here, each item comprises a <term>term</term> and a
        <term>gloss</term>, marked with <gi>label</gi> and <gi>item</gi> respectively. These
        correspond to the elements <gi>term</gi> and <gi>gloss</gi>, which can occur anywhere in prose
        text. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        </p>
        <p>Where the internal structure of a list item is more complex, it may be preferable to regard
        the list as a <term>table</term>, for which special-purpose tagging is defined below (<ptr target="#U5-tables"/>). </p>
        <p>Lists of whatever kind can, of course, nest within list items to any depth required. Here,
        for example, a glossary list contains two items, each of which is itself a simple list: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <list type="gloss">
          <label>EVIL</label>
          <item>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>I am cast upon a horrible desolate island, void of all hope of recovery.</item>
              <item>I am singled out and separated as it were from all the world to be miserable.</item>
              <item>I am divided from mankind — a solitaire; one banished from human society.</item>

          <item>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>But I am alive; and not drowned, as all my ship's company were.</item>
              <item>But I am singled out, too, from all the ship's crew, to be spared from
              death...</item>
              <item>But I am not starved, and perishing on a barren place, affording no
              sustenances....</item>
            </list>
          </item>
        </list>
      </egXML>
        </p>
        <p>A list need not necessarily be displayed in list format. For example, <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        <p>It is often useful to distinguish bibliographic citations where they occur within texts being
        transcribed for research, if only so that they will be properly formatted when the text is
        printed out. The element <gi>bibl</gi> is provided for this purpose. Where the components of a
        bibliographic reference are to be distinguished, the following elements may be used as
        appropriate. It is generally useful to mark at least those parts (such as the titles of
        articles, books, and journals) which will need special formatting. The other elements are
        provided for cases where particular interest attaches to such details. <specList>

        <p>Not all the components of a document are necessarily textual. The most straightforward text

        text are inextricably intertwined, or electronic resources in which the two are complementary. </p>
        <p>The encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the text, possibly with a

        <figure>
          <graphic url="p412fig.png"/>
        </figure>
        <pb n="413"/>
        </egXML> This indicates that the
        graphic contained by the file <ident>p412fig.png</ident> appears between pages 412 and 413. </p>
        <p>The <gi>graphic</gi> element can appear anywhere that textual content is permitted, within
        but not between paragraphs or headings. In the following example, the encoder has decided to
        treat a specific printer's ornament as a heading: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <head>
          <graphic url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/>
        </head>
      </egXML>
        </p>
        <p>More usually, a graphic will have at the least an identifying title, which may be encoded
        using the <gi>head</gi> element, or a number of figures may be grouped together in a particular
        structure. It is also often convenient to include a brief description of the image. The
        <gi>figure</gi> element provides a means of wrapping one or more such elements together as a
        kind of graphic <soCalled>block</soCalled>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <figure>
          <graphic url="fessipic.png"/>
          <head>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</head>
          <figDesc>A Cruikshank
          engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading a group of revellers.</figDesc>
        </figure>
      </egXML>
        </p>
        <p>These cases should be carefully distinguished from the case where an encoded text is
        complemented by a collection of digital images, maintained as a distinct resource. The
        <att>facs</att> attribute may be used to associate any element in an encoded text with a
        digital facsimile of it. In the simple case where only page images are available, the
        <att>facs</att> attribute on the <gi>pb</gi> element may be used to associate each image with
        an appropriate point in the text: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <text>
          <pb facs="page1.png" n="1"/>
          <!-- text contained on page 1 is encoded here -->
          <pb facs="page2.png" n="2"/>
          <!-- text contained on page 2 is encoded here -->
        </text>
        </egXML> This method is only appropriate in the simple case where each digital image file
        <ident>page1.png</ident> etc. corresponds with a single transcribed and encoded page. If more
        detailed alignment of image and transcription is required, for example because the image files
        actually represent double page spreads, more sophisticated mechanisms are provided in the full
        TEI Guidelines. </p>

        <head>Interpretation and Analysis</head>
        <p>It is often said that <emph>all</emph> markup is a form of interpretation or analysis. While
        it is certainly difficult, and may be impossible, to distinguish firmly between
        <soCalled>objective</soCalled> and <soCalled>subjective</soCalled> information in any
        universal way, it remains true that judgments concerning the latter are typically regarded as
        more likely to provide controversy than those concerning the former. Many scholars therefore
        prefer to record such interpretations only if it is possible to alert the reader that they are
        considered more open to dispute, than the rest of the markup. This section describes some of
        the elements provided by the TEI scheme to meet this need. </p>
        <div>
          <head>Orthographic Sentences</head>
          <p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with no particular respect to
          other structural units. A useful preliminary to intensive interpretation is therefore to
          segment the text into discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label for
          use as a sort of <soCalled>canonical reference</soCalled>. To facilitate such uses, these
          units may not cross each other, nor nest within each other. They may conveniently be
          represented using the following element: <specList>
          <specDesc key="s"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>As the name suggests, the <gi>s</gi> element is most commonly used (in linguistic
          applications at least) for marking <term>orthographic sentences</term>, that is, units defined
          by orthographic features such as punctuation. For example, the passage from <title>Jane
          Eyre</title> discussed earlier might be divided into s-units as follows:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <pb n="474"/>
          <div type="chapter" n="38">
            <p>
              <s n="001">Reader, I married him.</s>
              <s n="002">A quiet wedding we had:</s>
              <s n="003">he
              and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.</s>
              <s n="004">When we got back from
              church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner, and
              John cleaning the knives, and I said —</s>
            </p>
            <p>
              <q>
                <s n="005">Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.</s>
            </q> ... </p>
          </div>
          </egXML> Note that <gi>s</gi> elements cannot nest: the beginning of one <gi>s</gi>
          element implies that the previous one has finished. When s-units are tagged as shown above, it
          is advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that every word in the text being analysed
          will be contained by exactly one <gi>s</gi> element, whose identifier can then be used to
          specify a unique reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within the document,
          then the <att>xml:id</att> attribute might be used in preference to the <att>n</att> used in
          the above example.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Words and punctuation</head>
          <p>Tokenization, that is, the identification of
          lexical or non-lexical tokens within a text, is a very common requirement for all kinds of
          textual analysis, and not an entirely trivial one. The decision as to whether, for example,
          <q>can't</q> in English or <q>du</q> in French should be treated as one word or two is not
          simple. Consequently it is often useful to make explicit the preferred tokenization in a
          marked up text. The following elements are available for this purpose: <specList>
          <specDesc key="w"/>
          <specDesc key="pc"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>For example, the output from a part of speech tagger might be recorded in TEI Lite as
          follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <s n="1">
            <w ana="#NP0">Marley</w>
            <w ana="#VBD">was</w>
            <w ana="#AJ0">dead</w>
            <pc>:</pc>
            <w ana="#TO0">to</w>
            <w ana="#VBB">begin</w>
            <w ana="#PRP">with</w>
            <pc>. </pc>
          </s>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>In this example, each word has been decorated with an automatically generated part of
          speech code, using the <att>ana</att> attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>
          above. The <gi>w</gi> also provides for each word to be associated with a root form or lemma,
          either explicitly using the <att>lemma</att> attribute, or by reference, using the
          <att>lemmaRef</att> attribute, as in this example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">...<w ana="#VBD" lemma="be" lemmaRef="http://www.myLexicon.com/be">was</w> ... </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>General-Purpose Interpretation Elements</head>
          <p>The <gi>w</gi> element is a specialisation of the <gi>seg</gi> element which has already
          been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked targets of cross references and
          hypertext links (see section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>); it identifies some phrase-level
          portion of text to which the encoder may assign a user-specified <att>type</att>, as well as a
          unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag textual features for which there is no other
          provision in the published TEI Guidelines.</p>
          <p>For example, the Guidelines provide no <soCalled>apostrophe</soCalled> element to mark parts
          of a literary text in which the narrator addresses the reader (or hearer) directly. One
          approach might be to regard these as instances of the <gi>q</gi> element, distinguished from
          others by an appropriate value for the <att>who</att> attribute. A possibly simpler, and
          certainly more general, solution would however be to use the <gi>seg</gi> element as follows:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <div type="chapter" n="38">
              <p>
              <seg type="apostrophe">Reader, I married him.</seg> A quiet wedding we had: ...</p>
            </div>
            </egXML> The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>seg</gi> element can take any value,
            and so can be used to record phrase-level phenomena of any kind; it is good practice to record
          the values used and their significance in the header.</p>
          <p>A <gi>seg</gi> element of one type (unlike the <gi>s</gi> element which it superficially
          resembles) can be nested within a <gi>seg</gi> element of the same or another type. This
          enables quite complex structures to be represented; some examples were given in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above. However, because it must respect the requirement that elements be
          properly nested and may not cut across each other, it cannot cope with the common requirement
          to associate an interpretation with arbitrary segments of a text which may completely ignore
          the document hierarchy. It also requires that the interpretation itself be represented by a
          single coded value in the <att>type</att> attribute.</p>
          <p>Neither restriction applies to the <gi>interp</gi> element, which provides powerful features
          for the encoding of quite complex interpretive information in a relatively straightforward
          manner. <specList>
          <specDesc key="interp"/>
          <specDesc key="interpGrp"/>
          </specList> These elements allow the encoder to specify both the class of an interpretation,
          and the particular instance of that class which the interpretation involves. Thus, whereas
          with <gi>seg</gi> one can say simply that something is an apostrophe, with <gi>interp</gi> one
          can say that it is an instance (apostrophe) of a larger class (rhetorical figures).</p>
          <p>Moreover, <gi>interp</gi> is a <soCalled>stand off</soCalled>
          element: it does not surround the segments of text which it
          describes, but instead is  linked to the passage in question
          either by means of the <att>ana</att> attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above, or by means of its own <att>inst</att> attribute. This means that
          any kind of analysis can be represented, independently of the
          document hierarchy, as well as
          facilitating the grouping of analyses of a particular type together. A special purpose
          <gi>interpGrp</gi> element is provided for the latter purpose.</p>
          <p>For example, suppose that you wish to mark such diverse aspects of a text as themes or
          subject matter, rhetorical figures, and the locations of individual scenes of the narrative.
          Different portions of our sample passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title> for example, might be
          associated with the rhetorical figures of apostrophe, hyperbole, and metaphor; with
          subject-matter references to churches, servants, cooking, postal service, and honeymoons; and
          with scenes located in the church, in the kitchen, and in an unspecified location (drawing
          room?).</p>
          <p>These interpretations could be placed anywhere within the <gi>text</gi> element; it is
          however good practice to put them all in the same place (e.g. a separate section of the front
          or back matter), as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <back>
            <div type="Interpretations">
              <p>
                <interp xml:id="fig-apos-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figureOfSpeech">apostrophe</interp>
                <interp xml:id="fig-hyp-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figureOfSpeech">hyperbole</interp>
                <interp xml:id="set-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="setting">church</interp>
                <interp xml:id="ref-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference">church</interp>
                <interp xml:id="ref-serv-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference">servants</interp>
              </p>
            </div>
          </back>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The evident redundancy of this encoding can be considerably reduced by using the
          <gi>interpGrp</gi> element to group together all those <gi>interp</gi> elements which share
          common attribute values, as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <back>
            <div type="Interpretations">
              <p>
                <interpGrp type="figureOfSpeech" resp="#LB-MSM">
                  <interp xml:id="fig-apos">apostrophe</interp>
                  <interp xml:id="fig-hyp">hyperbole</interp>
                  <interp xml:id="fig-meta">metaphor</interp>
                </interpGrp>
                <interpGrp type="scene-setting" resp="#LB-MSM">
                  <interp xml:id="set-church">church</interp>
                  <interp xml:id="set-kitch">kitchen</interp>
                  <interp xml:id="set-unspec">unspecified</interp>
                </interpGrp>
                <interpGrp type="reference" resp="#LB-MSM">
                  <interp xml:id="ref-church">church</interp>
                  <interp xml:id="ref-serv">servants</interp>
                  <interp xml:id="ref-cook">cooking</interp>
                </interpGrp>
              </p>
            </div>
          </back>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>Once these interpretation elements have been defined, they can be linked with the parts of
          the text to which they apply in either or both of two ways. The <att>ana</att> attribute can
          be used on whichever element is appropriate: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <div type="chapter" n="38">
            <p xml:id="P38.1" ana="#set-church #set-kitch">
              <s xml:id="P38.1.1" ana="#fig-apos">Reader, I
              married him.</s>
            </p>
          </div>
          </egXML> Note in this example that since the paragraph has two settings (in the church
          and in the kitchen), the identifiers of both have been supplied.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, the <gi>interp</gi> elements can point to all the parts of the text to which
          they apply, using their <att>inst</att> attribute: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <interp xml:id="fig-apos-2"
                  type="figureOfSpeech"
                  resp="#LB-MSM"
                  inst="#P38.1.1">apostrophe</interp>
          <interp xml:id="set-church-2"
                  type="scene-setting"
                  inst="#P38.1"
                  resp="#LB-MSM">church</interp>
          <interp xml:id="set-kitchen-2"
                  type="scene-setting"
                  inst="#P38.1"
                  resp="#LB-MSM">kitchen</interp>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>interp</gi> element is not limited to any particular type of analysis. The literary
          analysis shown above is but one possibility; one could equally well use <gi>interp</gi> to
          capture a linguistic part-of-speech analysis. For example, the example sentence given in
          section <ptr target="#xatts"/> assumes a linguistic analysis which might be represented as
          follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <interp xml:id="NP1" type="pos">noun
          phrase, singular</interp>
          <interp xml:id="VV1" type="pos">inflected verb, present-tense
          singular</interp> ... </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="U5-techdoc">
        <head>Technical Documentation</head>
        <p>Although the focus of this document is on the use of the TEI scheme for the encoding of
        existing <soCalled>pre-electronic</soCalled> documents, the same scheme may also be used for
        the encoding of new documents. In the preparation of new documents (such as this one), XML has
        much to recommend it: the document's structure can be clearly represented, and the same
        electronic text can be re-used for many purposes — to provide both online hypertext or
        browsable versions and well-formatted typeset versions from a common source for example. </p>
        <p>To facilitate this, the TEI Lite schema includes some elements for marking features of
        technical documents in general, and of XML-related documents in particular.</p>
        <div>
          <head>Additional Elements for Technical Documents</head>
          <p>The following elements may be used to mark particular features of technical documents: <specList>
          <specDesc key="eg"/>
          <specDesc key="code"/>
          <specDesc key="ident"/>
          <specDesc key="gi"/>
          <specDesc key="att"/>
          <specDesc key="formula"/>
          <specDesc key="val"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to encode a passage from a
          tutorial introducing the Fortran programming language: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <p>It is traditional to introduce a language with a
          program like the following: <eg xml:space="preserve"> CHAR*12 GRTG
          GRTG = 'HELLO WORLD' 
          PRINT *, GRTG 
          END
        </eg>
          </p>
          <p>This simple example first declares a variable <ident>GRTG</ident>, in the line
          <code>CHAR*12 GRTG</code>, which identifies <ident>GRTG</ident> as consisting of 12 bytes
          of type <ident>CHAR</ident>. To this variable, the value <val>HELLO WORLD</val> is then
          assigned.</p>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>A formatting application, given a text like that above, can be instructed to format examples
          appropriately (e.g. to preserve line breaks, or to use a distinctive font). Similarly, the use
          of tags such as <gi>ident</gi> greatly facilitates the construction of a useful index.</p>
          <p>The <gi>formula</gi> element should be used to enclose a mathematical or chemical formula
          presented within the text as a distinct item. Since formulae generally include a large variety
          of special typographic features not otherwise present in ordinary text, it will usually be
          necessary to present the body of the formula in a specialized notation. The notation used
          should be specified by the <att>notation</att> attribute, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <formula notation="tex"> \begin{math}E =
          mc^{2}\end{math} </formula>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>A particular problem arises when XML encoding is the subject of discussion within a
          technical document, itself encoded in XML. In such a document, it is clearly essential to
          distinguish clearly the markup occurring within examples from that marking up the document
          itself, and end-tags are highly likely to occur. One simple solution is to use the predefined
          entity reference <code>&amp;lt;</code> to represent each &lt; character which marks the start
          of an XML tag within the examples. A more general solution is to mark off the whole body of
          each example as containing data which is not to be scanned for XML mark-up by the parser. This
          is achieved by enclosing it within a special XML construct called a <term>
          <code>CDATA</code>
          marked section</term>, as in the following example: <eg xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;A list should be encoded as
          follows: &lt;eg&gt;&lt;![ CDATA [ &lt;list&gt; &lt;item&gt;First item in the
          list&lt;/item&gt; &lt;item&gt;Second item&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/list&gt; ]]&gt; &lt;/eg&gt; The
          &lt;gi&gt;list&lt;/gi&gt; element consists of a series of &lt;gi&gt;item&lt;/gi&gt;
          elements.</eg>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>list</gi> element used within the example above will not be regarded as forming part
          of the document proper, because it is embedded within a marked section (beginning with the
          special markup declaration <val>&lt;![CDATA[ </val>, and ending with <val>]]&gt;</val>).</p>
          <p>Note also the use of the <gi>gi</gi> element to tag references to element names (or
          <term>generic identifiers</term>) within the body of the text.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Generated Divisions</head>
          <p>Most modern document production systems have the ability to generate automatically whole
          sections such as a table of contents or an index. The TEI Lite scheme provides an element to
          mark the location at which such a generated section should be placed. <specList>
          <specDesc key="divGen"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>divGen</gi> element can be placed anywhere that a division element would be legal,
          as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <front>
            <titlePage>
              <!-- ... -->
            </titlePage>
            <divGen type="toc"/>
            <div>
              <head>Preface</head>
              <!-- ... -->
            </div>
          </front>
          <body>
            <!-- ... -->
          </body>
          <back>
            <div>
              <head>Appendix</head>
              <!-- ... -->
            </div>
            <divGen type="index" n="Index"/>
          </back>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>This example also demonstrates the use of the <att>type</att> attribute to distinguish the
          different kinds of division to be generated: in the first case a table of contents (a
          <mentioned>toc</mentioned>) and in the second an index.</p>
          <p>When an existing index or table of contents is to be encoded (rather than one being
          generated) for some reason, the <gi>list</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-lists"/> should be used. </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="indexing">
          <head>Index Generation</head>
          <p>While production of a table of contents from a properly tagged document is generally
          unproblematic for an automatic processor, the production of a good quality index will often
          require more careful tagging. It may not be enough simply to produce a list of all parts
          tagged in some particular way, although extracting (for example) all occurrences of elements
          such as <gi>term</gi> or <gi>name</gi> will often be a good departure point for an index. </p>
          <p>The TEI schema provides a special purpose <gi>index</gi> tag which may be used to mark both
          the parts of the document which should be indexed, and how the indexing should be done. <specList>
          <specDesc key="index"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>For example, the second paragraph of this section might include the following:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... TEI lite also provides a special purpose
          <gi>index</gi> tag <index>
          <term>indexing</term>
        </index>
        <index>
          <term>index (tag)</term>
          <index>
            <term>use in index generation</term>
          </index>
        </index>
        which may be used ...</egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>index</gi> element can also be used to provide a form of interpretive or analytic
          information. For example, in a study of Ovid, it might be desired to record all the poet's
          references to different figures, for comparative stylistic study. In the following lines of
          the <title>Metamorphoses</title>, such a study would record the poet's references to Jupiter
          (as <mentioned>deus</mentioned>, <mentioned>se</mentioned>, and as the subject of
          <mentioned>confiteor</mentioned> [in inflectional form number 227]), to
          Jupiter-in-the-guise-of-a-bull (as <mentioned>imago tauri fallacis</mentioned> and the subject
          of <mentioned>teneo</mentioned>), and so on.<note place="foot">The analysis is taken, with
          permission, from Willard McCarty and Burton Wright, <title>An Analytical Onomasticon to the
          Metamorphoses of Ovid</title> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, forthcoming). Some
          simplifications have been undertaken.</note>

        <head>Character Sets, Diacritics, etc.</head>
        <p>With the advent of XML and its adoption of Unicode as the required character set for all
        documents, most problems previously associated with the representation of the divers languages
        and writing systems of the world are greatly reduced. For those working with standard forms of
        the European languages in particular, almost no special action is needed: any XML editor should
        enable you to input accented letters or other <soCalled>non-ASCII</soCalled> characters
        directly, and they should be stored in the resulting file in a way which is transferable
        directly between different systems. </p>
        <p>There are two important exceptions: the characters &amp; and &lt; may not be entered directly
        in an XML document, since they have a special significance as initiating markup. They must
        always be represented as <term>entity references</term>, like this: <code>&amp;amp;</code> or
        <code>&amp;lt;</code>. Other characters may also be represented by means of entity reference
        where necessary, for example to retain compatibility with a pre-Unicode processing system. </p>

          <p>For many purposes, particularly in older texts, the preliminary material such as title

          information. P5 provides a set of recommendations for distinguishing the textual elements most
          commonly encountered in front matter, which are summarized here.</p>
          <div xml:id="h51">
            <head>Title Page</head>
            <p>The start of a title page should be marked with the element <gi>titlePage</gi>. All text

            <p>Typeface distinctions should be marked with the <att>rend</att> attribute when necessary,
            as described above. Very detailed description of the letter spacing and sizing used in
            ornamental titles is not as yet provided for by the Guidelines. Changes of language should be
            marked by appropriate use of the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute or the <gi>foreign</gi>
            element, as necessary. Names of people, places, or organizations, may be tagged using the

            <p>Major blocks of text within the front matter should be marked using
            <gi>div</gi> elements; the following suggested values for the <att>type</att> attribute may

            explains the content, purpose, or origin of the text</item>
            <label>dedication</label>
            <item>A formal offering or dedication of a text to one or more persons or institutions by

            <label>contents</label>
            <item>A table of contents, specifying the structure of a work and listing its constituents.
            The <gi>list</gi> element should be used to mark its structure.</item>
            <label>frontispiece</label>
            <item>A pictorial frontispiece, possibly including some text.</item>
          </list>
            </p>
            <p>Where other kinds of prefatory matter are encountered, the encoder is at liberty to invent
            other values for the <att>type</att> attribute.</p>
            <p>Like any text division, those in front matter may contain low level structural or
            non-structural elements as described elsewhere. They will generally begin with a heading or
            title of some kind which should be tagged using the <gi>head</gi> element. Epistles will
            contain the following additional elements: <specList>
            <specDesc key="salute"/>
            <specDesc key="signed"/>
            <specDesc key="byline"/>

            <p> Epistles which appear elsewhere in a text will, of course, contain these same
            elements.</p>
            <p>As an example, the dedication at the start of Milton's <title>Comus</title> should be

        <head>The Electronic Title Page</head>
        <p>Every TEI text has a header which provides information analogous to that provided by the
        title page of printed text. The header is introduced by the element <gi>teiHeader</gi> and has
        four major parts: <specList>
        <specDesc key="fileDesc"/>
        <specDesc key="encodingDesc"/>
        <specDesc key="profileDesc"/>
        <specDesc key="revisionDesc"/>
      </specList>
        </p>
        <p> A corpus or collection of texts with many shared characteristics may have one header for
        the corpus and individual headers for each component of the corpus. In this case the
        <att>type</att> attribute indicates the type of header. <code>&lt;teiHeader
        type="corpus"&gt;</code> introduces the header for corpus-level information.</p>
        <p>Some of the header elements contain running prose which consists of one or more <gi>p</gi>s.
        Others are grouped: <list>
        <item>Elements whose names end in <mentioned>Stmt</mentioned> (for statement) usually enclose a
        group of elements recording some structured information.</item>
        <item>Elements whose names end in <mentioned>Decl</mentioned> (for declaration) enclose
        information about specific encoding practices.</item>
        <item>Elements whose names end in <mentioned>Desc</mentioned> (for description) contain a
        prose description.</item>

            However, it is important to distinguish the title of the computer file from that of the

            <label>hyphenation</label>
            <item>what has been done with hyphens (especially end-of-line hyphens) in the original --
            have they been retained, replaced by entity references, etc.</item>
            <label>segmentation</label>
            <item>how has the text has been segmented, for example into sentences, tone-units, graphemic

            <head>Reference and Classification Declarations</head>
            <p>The <gi>refsDecl</gi> element is used to document the way in which any standard referencing
            scheme built into the encoding works. In its simplest form, it consists of prose
            description.</p>
            <p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <refsDecl>
              <p>The <att>n</att>
              attribute on each <gi>div</gi> contains the canonical reference for each division in the
              form XX.yyy where XX is the book number in roman numeral and yyy is the section number in
              arabic.</p>
              <p>Milestone tags refer to the edition of 1830 as E30 and that of 1850 as E50.

            </refsDecl>
          </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>The <gi>classDecl</gi> element groups together definitions or sources for any descriptive
            classification schemes used by other parts of the header. At least one such scheme must be
            provided, encoded using the following elements: <specList>
            <specDesc key="taxonomy"/>
            <specDesc key="bibl"/>
            <specDesc key="category"/>
            <specDesc key="catDesc"/>
          </specList>
            </p>
            <p> In the simplest case, the taxonomy may be defined by a bibliographic reference, as in the
            following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <classDecl>
              <taxonomy xml:id="LC-SH">
                <bibl>Library of Congress Subject Headings
                </bibl>

            </classDecl>
          </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>Alternatively, or in addition, the encoder may define a special purpose classification
            scheme, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <taxonomy xml:id="B">

          <head>The Profile Description</head>
          <p>The <gi>profileDesc</gi> element enables information characterizing various descriptive

          <specDesc key="langUsage"/>
          <specDesc key="textClass"/>
        </specList>

          <p>The <gi>creation</gi> element is useful for documenting where a work was created, even

          <p>The <gi>langUsage</gi> element is useful where a text contains many different languages. It
          may contain <gi>language</gi> elements to document each particular language used: <specList>
          <specDesc key="language"/>
          </specList> For example, a text containing predominantly text in French as spoken in Quebec,
          but also smaller amounts of British and Canadian English might be documented as follows:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <langUsage>
              <language ident="fr-CA" usage="60">Québecois</language>
              <language ident="en-CA" usage="20">Canadian business English</language>
              <language ident="en-GB" usage="20">British English</language>
            </langUsage>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The <gi>textClass</gi> element classifies a text. This may be done with reference to a
          classification system locally defined by means of the <gi>classDecl</gi> element, or by
          reference to some externally defined established scheme such as the Universal Decimal
          Classification. Texts may also be classified using lists of keywords, which may themselves be
          drawn from locally or externally defined control lists. The following elements are used to
          supply such classifications: <specList>
          <specDesc key="classCode"/>
          <specDesc key="catRef"/>
          <specDesc key="keywords"/>
        </specList>
          </p>
          <p>The simplest way of classifying a text is by means of the <gi>classCode</gi> element. For
          example, a text with classification 410 in the Universal Decimal Classification might be
          documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <classCode scheme="http://www.udc.org">410</classCode>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>When a classification scheme has been locally defined using the <gi>taxonomy</gi> element
          discussed in the preceding subsection, the <gi>catRef</gi> element should be used to reference
          it. To continue the earlier example, a work classified in the Brown Corpus as <code>Press
          reportage - Sunday</code> and also as <code>Religion</code> might be documented as follows:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <catRef target="#B.A3 #B.D"/>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>The element <gi>keywords</gi> contains a list of keywords or phrases identifying the topic
          or nature of a text. As usual, the attribute <att>scheme</att> identifies the source from
          which these terms are taken. For example, if the LC Subject Headings are used, following
          declaration of that classification system in a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element as above : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <textClass>
            <keywords scheme="#LCSH">
              <list>
                <item>English literature -- History and criticism -- Data processing.</item>
                <item>English literature -- History and criticism -- Theory etc.</item>
                <item>English language -- Style -- Data processing.</item>
              </list>
            </keywords>
          </textClass>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>Multiple classifications may be supplied using
          any of the mechanisms described in this section.</p>

          <head>The Revision Description</head>
          <p>The <gi>revisionDesc</gi> element provides a change log in which each change made to a text
          may be recorded. The log may be recorded as a sequence of <gi>change</gi> elements each of
          which contains a brief description of the change. The attributes <att>when</att> and
          <att>who</att> may be used to identify when the change was carried out and the agency
          responsible for it. </p>
          <p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <revisionDesc>
            <change when="1991-03-06" who="#EMB">File format updated</change>
            <change when="1990-05-25" who="#EMB">Stuart's corrections entered</change>
          </revisionDesc>
        </egXML>
          </p>
          <p>In a production environment it will usually be found preferable to use some kind of
          automated system to track and record changes. Many such <term>version control systems</term>,
          as they are known, can also be configured to update the TEI Header of a file automatically.

        <head>List of Elements Described</head>
        <p>The TEI Lite schema is a pure subset of TEI P5. In the following list of elements and classes
        used, some information, notably the examples, derives from the canonical definition for the
        element in TEI P5 and may therefore refer to elements or attributes not provided by TEI Lite.
        Note however that only the elements listed here are available within the TEI Lite schema. These
        specifications also refer to many attributes which although available in TEI Lite are not
        discussed in this tutorial for lack of space. </p>
