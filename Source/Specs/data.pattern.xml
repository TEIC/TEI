<remarks>
<p><q>A regular expression, often called a pattern, is an expression that
describes a set of strings. They are usually used to give a concise
description of a set, without having to list all elements. For
example, the set containing the three strings Handel, Händel, and
Haendel can be described by the pattern "H(ä|ae?)ndel" (or
alternatively, it is said that the pattern "H(ä|ae?)ndel" matches each
of the three strings)</q> [wikipedia]. </p>
