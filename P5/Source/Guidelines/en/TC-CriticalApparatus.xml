  <head>Critical Apparatus</head>
  <p>Scholarly editions of texts, especially texts of great antiquity or importance, often record
    some or all of the known variations among different <term>witnesses</term> to the text.
    Witnesses to a text may include authorial or other manuscripts, printed editions of the work,
    early translations, or quotations of a work in other texts. Information concerning variant
    readings of a text may be accumulated in highly structured form in a critical apparatus of
    variants. This chapter defines a module for use in encoding such an apparatus of variants, which
    may be used in conjunction with any of the modules defined in these Guidelines. It also defines
    an element class which provides extra attributes for some elements of the core tag set when this
    module is selected. In printed critical editions, the apparatus takes the form of highly-compressed
    notes at the bottom of each page. TEI’s critical apparatus module allows variation to be encoded
    so that such notes may be generated, but it also models the variation so that, for example,
    interactive editions in which readers can choose which witness readings to display are possible.</p>
  
  <p>Information about variant readings (whether or not represented by a critical apparatus in the
    source text) may be recorded in a series of <term>apparatus entries</term>, each entry
    documenting one <term>variation</term>, or set of readings, in the text. Elements for the
    apparatus entry and readings, and for the documentation of the witnesses whose readings are
    included in the apparatus, are described in section <ptr target="#TCAPLL"/>. Special tags for
    fragmentary witnesses are described in section <ptr target="#TCAPMI"/>. The available methods
    for embedding the apparatus in the rest of the text, or for linking an external apparatus to the
    text of the edition, are described in section <ptr target="#TCAPLK"/>. Finally, several extra
    attributes for some tags of the core tag set, made available when the additional tag set for
    text criticism is selected, are documented in section <ptr target="#PHCO"/>. </p>
  
  <p>Scholarly practice in representing critical editions differs widely across disciplines, time
    periods, and languages. The TEI does not make any recommendations as to which text-critical
    methods are best suited to any given text. Editors will wish to consider questions such as:
    <list type="simple">
      <item>What source documents will be used? Are there many witnesses, few, or one? Are the
        sources relatively close copies or not?</item>
      <item>Will there be a single <q>base</q> text? Or will witnesses be separately
        transcribed?</item>
      <item>If a single base text will be used, will it be that of a particular witness, or will the
        editor attempt to reconstruct an ideal or original text?</item>
      <item>Will each reading in an apparatus entry record every attestation (a <q>positive</q>
        apparatus), or merely witnesses that deviate from the base text (a <q>negative</q>
        apparatus)?</item>
      <item>Will the readings of most or all witnesses be represented in the apparatus, or only a
        selection the editor deems relevant?</item>
      <item>What level of variation will require distinguishing one witness reading from another?
        For example, will the editor consider an abbreviated word in a witness as agreeing with the
        base text, or not?</item>
      <item>Will conjectures (variant readings suggested by an editor) be treated differently than
        readings found in witnesses?</item>
      <item>Will there be a need to distinguish different types of variation, for example
        orthographic vs. morphological or lexical variants?</item>
    </list></p>
  
  <p>Different editorial methodologies will produce different answers to these questions, and those
    answers may influence choices of markup used in the edition. For example, if there will be
    multiple witness transcriptions and a single apparatus, then the <ref target="#TCAPDE">double
      end-point attachment</ref> method may be the best choice of apparatus linking style. The <ref
      target="#TCAPPS">parallel segmentation</ref> method may present several advantages to editors
    producing an edition with a single base text. Editors of single-source editions may care to note
    material aspects of the text (such as <gi>damage</gi> or <gi>unclear</gi> text). On the other
    hand, editors attempting to synthesize an ideal or original text from many witnesses may feel
    little need to represent the material aspects of individual witnesses. Editors wishing to
    distinguish witness readings from conjectures by modern editors may wish to use <att>wit</att>
    to indicate the former and <att>source</att> for the latter. Differences in types of variation
    might be marked using <att>type</att> or <att>ana</att> on the <gi>rdg</gi> element.</p>
  
  <p>Many examples given in this chapter refer to the following texts of the opening (usually just
    line 1) of Chaucer's <title>Wife of Bath's Prologue</title>, as it appears in each of the four
    different manuscripts <list rend="bulleted">

    <head>The Apparatus Entry, Readings, and Witnesses</head>
    <p>This section introduces the fundamental markup methods used to encode textual variations:
        <list rend="bulleted">
        <item>the <gi>app</gi> element for entries in the critical apparatus: see section <ptr target="#TCAPEN"/>.</item>
        <item>elements for identifying individual readings: see section <ptr target="#TCAPLR"/>.</item>
        <item>ways of grouping readings together: see section <ptr target="#TCAPSU"/>.</item>
        <item>methods of identifying which witnesses support a particular reading, and for
          describing the witnesses included in the apparatus: see section <ptr target="#TCAPLW"/>.</item>
        <item>elements for indicating which portions of a text are covered by fragmentary witnesses:
          see section <ptr target="#TCAPMI"/>.</item>
      </list></p>
    <p>The <gi>app</gi> element is in one sense a more sophisticated and complex version of the
        <gi>choice</gi> element introduced in <ptr target="#COEDCOR"/> as a way of marking points
      where the encoding of a passage in a single source may be carried out in more than one way.
      Unlike <gi>choice</gi>, however, the <gi>app</gi> element allows for the representation of
      many different versions of the same passage taken from different sources.</p>

    <div type="div3" xml:id="TCAPEN">
      <head>The Apparatus Entry</head>
      <p>Individual textual variations are encoded using the <gi>app</gi> element, which groups
        together all the readings constituting the variation. The identification of discrete textual
        variations or apparatus entries is not a purely mechanical process; different editors will
        group readings differently. No rules are given here as to how to collect readings into
        apparatus entries.</p>
      <p>The individual apparatus entry is encoded with the <gi>app</gi> element: <specList>
          <specDesc key="app" atts="type from to loc"/>
        </specList></p>
      <p>The attributes <att>loc</att>, <att>from</att>, and <att>to</att>, are used to link the
        apparatus entry to the base text, if present. In such cases, several methods may be used for
        such linkage, each involving a slightly different usage for these attributes. Linkage
        between text and apparatus is described below in section <ptr target="#TCAPLK"/>. For the
        use of the <gi>app</gi> element without a base text, see <ptr target="#TCAPPS"/>. </p>
      <p>Each <gi>app</gi> element usually comprises one or more readings, which in turn are encoded using
        the <gi>rdg</gi> or other elements, as described in the next section. A very simple partial
        apparatus for the first line of the <title>Wife of Bath's Prologue</title> might take a form
        something like this:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
   <rdg wit="#El">Experience though noon Auctoritee</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#La">Experiment thouh noon Auctoritee</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment though none auctorite</rdg>
</app></egXML>
        Of course, in practice the apparatus will be somewhat more complex. Specifically, it may be
        desired to record more obviously that manuscripts El and La agree on the words <q>noon
          Auctoritee</q>, to indicate a preference for one reading, etc. The following sections on
        readings, subvariation, and witness information describe some of the more important
        complications which can arise.</p>
      <specGrp xml:id="DTCAPEN" n="Apparatus entry"> <include xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../../Specs/app.xml"/> <include xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../../Specs/listApp.xml"/></specGrp>
    </div>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="TCAPLR">
      <head>Readings</head>
      <p>Individual readings are the crucial elements in any critical apparatus of variants. The
        following elements should be used to tag individual readings within an apparatus entry: <specList>
          <specDesc key="lem"/>
          <specDesc key="rdg"/>
        </specList> N.B. the term <term>lemma</term> is used here in the text-critical sense of
          <q>the reading accepted as that of the original or of the base text</q>. This sense
        differs from that in which the word is used elsewhere in the Guidelines, for example as in
        the attribute <att>lemma</att> where the intended sense is <q>the root form of an inflected
          word</q>, or <q>the heading of an entry in a reference book, especially a dictionary</q>.
        <!-- nor with
<q>a subsidiary proposition introduced in the proof of some other
proposition; a helping theorem.</q>--></p>
      <p>In recording readings within an apparatus entry, the <gi>rdg</gi> element should always be
        used; each <gi>app</gi> usually contains at least one <gi>rdg</gi>, though it may contain only 
        <gi>note</gi>s.</p>
      <p>The <gi>lem</gi> element may also be used to record the base text of the source edition, 
        to mark the readings of a base witness, to indicate the preference of an editor or encoder 
        for a particular reading, or (e.g. in the case of an external apparatus) to indicate 
        precisely to which portion of the main text the variation applies. Those who prefer to work 
        without the notion of a base text or who are not using the parallel segmentation method 
        may prefer not to use it at all. How it is used depends in part on the method chosen for 
        linking the apparatus to the text; for more information, see section <ptr target="#TCAPLK"/>.</p>
      <p>Readings may be encoded individually, or grouped for clarity using the <gi>rdgGrp</gi>
        element described in section <ptr target="#TCAPSU"/>.</p>
      <p>As members of the attribute class <ident type="class">att.textCritical</ident>, both of these elements 
         inherit the following attributes: <specList> <specDesc key="att.textCritical" atts="type cause varSeq hand"/> </specList>. 
        <gi>rdg</gi> (but not <gi>rdgGrp</gi>) is also a member of <ident type="class">att.witnessed</ident>: 
        <specList><specDesc key="att.witnessed" atts="wit"/></specList> These elements also inherit the following attributes from the 
        <ident type="class">att.global.responsibility</ident> class: <specList>
          <specDesc key="att.global.responsibility" atts="resp cert"/>
        </specList> As elsewhere, these attributes may be used to indicate the person responsible
        for the editorial decision being recorded, and also the degree of certainty associated with
        that decision by the person carrying out the encoding. </p>
      <p>The <att>wit</att> attribute identifies the witnesses which have the reading in question.
        It is required if the apparatus gathers together readings from different witnesses, but may
        be omitted in an apparatus recording the readings of only one witness, e.g. substitutions,
        divergent opinions on what is in the witness or on how to expand abbreviations, etc. Even in
        such a one-witness apparatus, however, the <att>wit</att> attribute may still be useful when
        it is desired to record the occurrence of a particular reading in some other witness. For
        other methods of identifying the witnesses to a reading, see section <ptr target="#TCAPLW"/>. </p>
      <p>The <att>type</att> attribute allows the encoder to classify readings in any convenient
        way, for example as substantive variants of the lemma:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
   <lem wit="#El #Hg">Experience</lem>
   <rdg wit="#La" type="substantive">Experiment</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#Ra2" type="substantive">Eryment</rdg>
</app></egXML>
        or as orthographic variants:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
   <lem wit="#El #Ra2">though</lem>
   <rdg wit="#La" type="orthographic">thouh</rdg>
</app></egXML></p>
      <p>The <att>varSeq</att> and <att>cause</att> attributes may be used to convey information on
        the sequence and cause of variation. In the following apparatus fragment, the reading
          <mentioned>Eryment</mentioned> is tagged as sequential to (derived from) the reading
          <mentioned>Experiment</mentioned>, and the cause is given as loss of the abbreviation for
          <mentioned>per</mentioned>.
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
   <rdg wit="#La" varSeq="1">Experiment</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#Ra2" cause="abbreviation_loss" varSeq="2">Eryment</rdg>
</app></egXML></p>
      <p>If a manuscript is written in several hands, and it is desired to report which hand wrote a
        particular reading, the <att>hand</att> attribute should be used. For example, in the Munich
        manuscript containing the <title>Carmina Burana</title>, the word
          <mentioned>alle</mentioned> has been changed to <mentioned>allen</mentioned>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="gmh" source="#COBICOR-eg-251"><l>Swaz hi gât umbe</l>
<l>daz sint alle megede,</l>
<l>die wellent ân man</l>
<l>
   <app>
      <rdg wit="#Mu" varSeq="1" hand="#m1">alle</rdg>
      <rdg wit="#Mu" cause="nachgetragen" varSeq="2" hand="#m2">allen</rdg>
   </app>
disen sumer gân.</l>

        <!-- (Anonymous VI).                                          --></p>
      <p>Similarly, if a witness is hard to decipher, it may be desired to indicate responsibility
        for the claim that a particular reading is supported by a particular witness. In line 2212a
        of <title>Beowulf</title>, for example, the manuscript is read in different ways by
        different scholars; the editor Klaeber prints one text, using parentheses to indicate his
        expansion, and records in the apparatus two different accounts of the manuscript reading, by
        Zupitza and Chambers:<note place="bottom">For the sake of legibility in the example, long
          marks over vowels are omitted. </note>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="ang" source="#TCAPLR-eg-11"><l>se ðe on

  </app></l>
<l>hord beweotode,</l></egXML>
      </p>
      <p>Because the <att>hand</att> attribute indicates a particular manuscript hand, it is intelligible 
        only on a reading from a single witness. If an encoder wishes to indicate that a particular 
        reading from a list in <att>wit</att> is in a particular hand, the <gi>witDetail</gi> element 
        should be used; see section <ptr target="#TCAPLW"/>.</p>
      <p>Where there is a greater weight of editorial discussion and interpretation than can
        conveniently be expressed through the attributes provided on these elements (for example
        where the editor wishes to discuss how a section of text might be punctuated) this information 
        can be attached to the apparatus in a note.</p>
      <p>The <gi>note</gi> element may also be used to record the specific wording of notes in the
        apparatus of the source edition, as here in a transcription of Friedrich Klaeber's note on
          <title>Beowulf</title> 2207a: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" source="#TCAPLR-eg-11"><l n="2207a">syððan <app><lem>Beowulfe</lem>
<note source="#Kl">Fol. 179a <mentioned>beowulfe</mentioned>.
  Folio 179, with the last page (Fol. 198b), is the worst part of the
  entire MS. It has been freshened up by a later hand, but not always
  correctly. Information on doubtful readings is in the notes of
  Zupitza and Chambers.</note></app></l>

        <!-- Klaeber, app. to 2207.                                   --> Notes providing details of
        the reading of one particular witness should be encoded using the specialized
          <gi>witDetail</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#TCAPLW"/>.</p>
      <p>Encoders should be aware of the distinct fields of use of the attribute values
          <att>wit</att>, <att>hand</att>, and <att>source</att>. Broadly, <att>wit</att> identifies
        the physical entity in which the reading is found (manuscript, clay tablet, papyrus, printed
        edition); <att>hand</att> refers to the agent responsible for inscribing that reading in
        that physical entity (scribe, author, inscriber, hand 1, hand 2); <att>source</att> indicates
        the scholar responsible for asserting the existence of that reading in that physical entity.
        In some cases, the categories may blur: a scholar may produce an edition introducing
        readings for which he or she is responsible; that edition may itself become a witness in a
        later critical apparatus. Thus, readings introduced as corrections in the earlier edition
        will be seen in the later apparatus as witnessed by the earlier edition. As observed in the
        discussion concerning the discrimination of <att>hand</att> and <att>resp</att> in 
        transcription of primary sources in section <ptr target="#PHHR"/>, the division of layers of
        responsibility through various scholars for particular aspects of a particular reading may
        require the more complex mechanisms for assigning responsibility described in chapter <ptr target="#CE"/>.</p>
      <specGrp xml:id="DTCAPLR" n="Readings"> <include xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../../Specs/lem.xml"/> <include xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="../../Specs/rdg.xml"/> </specGrp>

      <head>Indicating Subvariation in Apparatus Entries</head>
      <p>The <gi>rdgGrp</gi> element may be used to group readings, either because they have
        identical values on one or more attributes, or because they are seen as forming a
        self-contained variant sequence, or for some other reason. This grouping of readings is
        entirely optional: no such grouping of readings is required. <specList>
          <specDesc key="rdgGrp"/>
        </specList></p>
      <p>The <gi>rdgGrp</gi> element is a member of class <ident type="class">att.textCritical</ident> and therefore can carry the <att>type</att>,
          <att>cause</att>, <att>varSeq</att>, <att>hand</att>, and <att>resp</att> attributes
        described in the preceding section. When values for any of these attributes are given on a
          <gi>rdgGrp</gi> element, the values given are inherited by the <gi>rdg</gi> or
          <gi>lem</gi> elements nested within the reading group, unless overridden by a new
        specification on the individual reading element.</p>
      <p>To indicate that both Hg and La vary only orthographically from the lemma, one might tag
        both readings <tag>rdg type='orthographic'</tag>, as shown in the preceding section. This
        fact can be expressed more perspicuously, however, by grouping their readings into a
          <gi>rdgGrp</gi>, thus:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
   <lem wit="#El #Ra2">though</lem>
   <rdgGrp type="orthographic">
      <rdg wit="#La">thogh</rdg>
      <rdg wit="#Hg">thouh</rdg>
   </rdgGrp>
</app></egXML></p>
      <p>Similarly, <gi>rdgGrp</gi> may be used to organize the substantive variants of an apparatus
        entry. Editors may need to indicate that each of a group of witnesses may be taken as all
        supporting a particular reading, even though there may be variation concerning the exact
        form of that reading in, or the degree of support offered by, those witnesses. For example:
        one may identify three substantive variants on the first word of Chaucer's <title>Wife of
          Bath's Prologue</title> in the manuscripts: these might be expressed in regularized
        spelling as <mentioned>Experience</mentioned>, <mentioned>Experiment</mentioned>, and
          <mentioned>Eriment</mentioned>. In fact, the manuscripts display many different spellings
        of these words, and a scholar may wish both to show that the manuscripts have all these
        variant spellings and that these variant spellings actually support only the three
        regularized spelling forms. One may term these variant spellings as
          <soCalled>subvariants</soCalled> of the regularized spelling forms.</p>
      <p>This subvariation can be expressed within an <gi>app</gi> element by gathering the readings
        into three groups according to the normalized form of their reading. All the readings within
        each group may be accounted subvariants of the main reading for the group, which may be
        indicated by tagging it as a <gi>lem</gi> element or as <tag>rdg type='groupBase'</tag>.</p>
      <p>In this example, the different subvariants on <mentioned>Experience</mentioned>,
          <mentioned>Experiment</mentioned>, and <mentioned>Eriment</mentioned> are held within
        three <gi>rdgGrp</gi> elements nested within the enclosing <gi>app</gi> element:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app type="substantive">
    <rdgGrp type="subvariants">
         <lem wit="#El #Hg">Experience</lem>
        <rdg wit="#Ha4">Experiens</rdg>
     </rdgGrp>
    <rdgGrp type="subvariants">
        <lem wit="#Cp #Ld1">Experiment</lem>
        <rdg wit="#La">Ex<g ref="#per"/>iment</rdg>
    </rdgGrp>
    <rdgGrp type="subvariants">
      <lem resp="#ed2013">Eriment</lem>
        <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
     </rdgGrp>
</app></egXML>
        From this, one may deduce that the regularized reading <mentioned>Experience</mentioned> is
        supported by all three manuscripts El Hg Ha4, although the spelling differs in Ha4, and that
        the regularized reading <mentioned>Eriment</mentioned> is supported by Ra2, even though the
        form differs in that manuscript. Accordingly, an application which recognizes that these
        apparatus entries show subvariation may then assign all the witnesses instanced as attesting
        the sub-variants on that lemma as actually supporting the reading of the lemma itself at a
        higher level of classification. Thus, Ha4 here supports the reading
          <mentioned>Experience</mentioned> found in El and Hg, even though it is spelt slightly
        differently in Ha4.</p>
      <p>Reading groups may nest recursively, so that variants can be classified to any desired
        depth. Because apparatus entries may also nest, the <gi>app</gi> element might also be used
        to group readings in the same way. The example above is substantially identical to the
        following, which uses <gi>app</gi> instead of <gi>rdgGrp</gi>:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app n="a1" type="substantive">
   <rdg wit="#El #Hg #Ha4">        
      <app n="a2" type="orthographic">

         <rdg wit="#Ha4">Experiens</rdg>

   <rdg wit="#Ra2">

         <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
      </app>
   </rdg>
</app></egXML>
        This expresses even more clearly than the previous encoding of this material that at the
        highest level of classification (apparatus entry A1), this variation has three normalized
        readings, and that the first of these is supported by manuscripts El, Hg, and Ha4; the
        second by Cp, Ld1, and La; and the third by Ra2. Some encoders may find the use of nested
        apparatus entries less intuitive than the use of reading groups, however, so both methods of
        classifying the readings of a variation are allowed.</p>
      <p>Reading groups may also be used to bring together variants which form an apparent
        developmental sequence, and to make clear that other readings are not part of that sequence,
        as in the following example, which makes clear that the variant sequence
          <mentioned>experiment</mentioned> to <mentioned>eriment</mentioned> says nothing about the
        relative priority of <mentioned>experiment</mentioned> and
        <mentioned>experience</mentioned>:

      <head>Witness Information</head>
      <p>A given reading is associated with the set of witnesses attesting it by listing the
        witnesses in the <att>wit</att> attribute on the <gi>rdg</gi> or <gi>lem</gi> element. Special 
        mechanisms, described in the following sections, are needed to associate annotation on a reading 
        with one specific witness among several (section <ptr target="#TCAPWD"/>), to transcribe 
        witness information verbatim from a source edition (section <ptr target="#TCSCWL"/>), and to 
        identify the formal lists of witnesses typically provided in the front matter of critical 
        editions (section <ptr target="#TCAPWL"/>).</p>
      <div type="div4" xml:id="TCAPWD">
        <head>Witness Detail Information</head>
        <p>When it is desired to give additional information about the reading of a particular witness 
          or witnesses, such as noting that it appears in the margin or was corrected
          for the reading, that information may be given in a <gi>witDetail</gi> element. This is a
          specialized note, which can be linked to both a reading and to one or more of the
          witnesses for that reading. The link to the reading may be inferred from <gi>witDetail</gi>'s 
          position or made explicit by the <att>target</att> attribute which <gi>witDetail</gi> inherits 
          from the attribute class 
          <ident type="class">att.pointing</ident>; the link to the witness, by the <att>wit</att> attribute. <specList>
            <specDesc key="att.pointing" atts="target"/>
            <specDesc key="witDetail" atts="wit"/>
          </specList></p>
        <p>Because it annotates an attribute value, <gi>witDetail</gi> cannot be included in the text at the point of
          attachment; without a <att>target</att> attribute, it refers to the closest preceding <gi>lem</gi> or <gi>rdg</gi>. 
          But if there is any ambiguity or if the <gi>witDetail</gi> refers to multiple readings, <att>target</att> must be 
          used to point to the reading(s) being annotated. To indicate that the
          Ellesmere manuscript has an ornamental capital in the word
            <mentioned>Experience</mentioned>, for example, one might write:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app type="substantive">
  <lem wit="#El #Hg">Experience</lem>
  <witDetail wit="#El">Ornamental capital.</witDetail>
  <rdg wit="#Ha4">Experiens</rdg>
</app>
</egXML>
          This encoding makes clear that the ornamental capital mentioned is in the Ellesmere
          manuscript, and not in Hengwrt or Ha4. </p>
        <p>Like <gi>note</gi>, <gi>witDetail</gi> may be used to record the specific wording of
          information in the source text, even when the information itself is captured in some more
          formal way elsewhere. The example from the <title>Carmina Burana</title> above (section
            <ptr target="#TCAPLR"/>), for example, might be extended thus, to record the wording of
          the note explaining that the variant reading adds <mentioned>n</mentioned> to the original 
          in a second hand: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="gmh" source="#COBICOR-eg-251"><l>Swaz hi gât umbe</l>

        <p>Although <gi>witDetail</gi> provides a good way to annotate witness references in <att>wit</att>, lists
          of sigla <note place="bottom">The Latin word <foreign>siglum</foreign> (<gloss>sign</gloss>), pl. 
          <foreign>sigla</foreign> denotes the abbreviation used in a critical apparatus to indicate a 
          particular witness.</note> may be complex enough that it is impractical to use the combination of 
          <att>wit</att> and <gi>witDetail</gi>.
          Moreover, in the transcription of printed critical editions, it may be desirable to retain for
          future reference the exact form in which the source edition records the witnesses to a
          particular reading; this is particularly important in cases of ambiguity in the
          information, or uncertainty as to the correct interpretation. The <gi>wit</gi> element may
          be used to transcribe such lists of witnesses to a particular reading. <specList>
            <specDesc key="wit"/>
          </specList> The <gi>wit</gi> list may appear following a <gi>rdg</gi>, <gi>rdgGrp</gi>, or
            <gi>lem</gi> element in any apparatus entry. <gi>wit</gi> may be used in a way functionally equivalent
          to <att>wit</att> if the sigla therein are wrapped in <gi>ref</gi>s with <att>target</att> attributes
          pointing to a predefined witness. For example 
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
            <lem>Nondum</lem>
            <rdg wit="#G #P" xml:id="rdg1.1nundum" ana="#orthographical">nundum</rdg>
            <witDetail wit="#G" target="#rdg1.1nundum">corr. <ref
                target="#G1">G<hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></witDetail>
            </app>
          </egXML>
          which indicates that the reading <q>nundum</q> for <q>nondum</q> is to be found in MSS G (although it is 
          corrected to <foreign>nondum</foreign> in the primary hand) and P, might be written:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
            <lem>Nondum</lem>
            <rdg wit="#G #P" ana="#orthographical">nundum</rdg>

          </app>
          </egXML>
          This is somewhat more verbose, but accomplishes the same goal. Because <att>wit</att> is more succinct, and because it makes
          the automated verification of correct witness references easier, using <att>wit</att> (with <gi>witDetail</gi> when
          needed) is almost always to be preferred.

        <head>The Witness List</head>
        <p>A list of all identified witnesses should normally be supplied in the front matter of the
          edition, or in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element of its header. This may be given either as
          a simple bibliographic list, using the <gi>listBibl</gi> element described in 
          <ptr target="#COBI"/>, or as a <gi>listWit</gi> element, which contains a series of
            <gi>witness</gi> elements. Each <gi>witness</gi> element may contain a brief
          characterization of the witness, given as one or more prose paragraphs. If more detailed
          information about a manuscript witness is available, it should be represented using the
            <gi>msDesc</gi> element provided by the <ident type="module">msdescription</ident>
          module; an <gi>msDesc</gi> may appear within a <gi>listBibl</gi>. </p>
        <p>Whether information about a particular witness is supplied by means of a <gi>bibl</gi>,
            <gi>msDesc</gi>, or <gi>witness</gi> element, a unique siglum for this source should
          always be supplied, using the global <att>xml:id</att> attribute. This identifier can then
          be used elsewhere to refer to this particular witness. <specList>
            <specDesc key="listWit"/>
            <specDesc key="witness"/>
            <specDesc key="msDesc"/>

            <specDesc key="listBibl"/>
          </specList></p>
        <p>The minimal information provided by a witness list is thus the set of sigla for all the
          witnesses named in the apparatus. For example, the witnesses referenced by the examples of
          this chapter might simply be listed thus:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="und" source="#UND"><listWit>
   <witness xml:id="Chi3"/>
   <witness xml:id="Ha4"/>
   <witness xml:id="Ju"/> 
   <witness xml:id="K"/>  
   <witness xml:id="Kb"/>  
   <witness xml:id="Kl"/> 
   <witness xml:id="Kv"/>  
   <witness xml:id="Ld"/>
   <witness xml:id="Ld1"/> 
   <witness xml:id="Ln"/>
   <witness xml:id="Mu"/>  
   <witness xml:id="Ry2"/>
   <witness xml:id="Wa"/>  
   <witness xml:id="X"/>   
</listWit></egXML></p>
        <p>It is more helpful, however, for witness lists to be somewhat more informative: each
            <gi>witness</gi> element should contain at least a brief prose description of the
          witness, perhaps including a bibliographic citation, as in the following examples:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><listWit>
  <witness xml:id="El">Ellesmere, Huntingdon Library 26.C.9</witness>
  <witness xml:id="Hg">Hengwrt, National Library of Wales,

  <witness xml:id="Ra2">Bodleian Library Rawlinson Poetic 149
(see further <ptr target="http://example.com/msDescs#MSRP149"/>)</witness>
</listWit></egXML>
          As the last example shows, the witness description here may be complemented by a reference
          to a full description of the manuscript supplied elsewhere, typically as the content of an
            <gi>msDesc</gi> or <gi>bibl</gi> element. Alternatively, it may contain a whole
          paragraph of commentary for each witness: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="de" source="#COBICOR-eg-251"><listWit>

        <p>It would however generally be preferable to represent such detailed information using an
          appropriately structured <gi>msDesc</gi> element, as discussed in chapter <ptr target="#MS"/>. Note also that if the witnesses being recorded are not manuscripts but
          printed works, it may be preferable to document them using the standard <gi>bibl</gi> or
            <gi>biblStruct</gi> elements described in <ptr target="#COBI"/>, as in this example:

        <p>In text-critical work it is customary to refer to frequently occurring groups of
          witnesses by means of a single common siglum. Such sigla may be documented as
          pseudo-witnesses in their own right by including a nested witness list within the witness
          list, which uses the siglum for the group as its identifier, and supplies a fuller name for
          the group in its optional child <gi>head</gi> element, before listing the other witnesses
          contained by the group.
          For example, the Constant Group C of manuscripts comprising witnesses Cp, La, and S12,
          might be represented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

          Here we have a summary of the witnesses, with their sigla, used in an edition, as is generally
          found in the <foreign>conspectus siglorum</foreign> in the front matter of a critical edition.
          Families are indicated with Greek letters and manuscript witnesses with Latin letters. The siglum for
          display is always contained in the <gi>abbr</gi> with <att>type</att> <q>siglum</q> child of each
          witness, so it is always easy to retrieve the display siglum for a given identifier reference. 
        </p>


        <p>Situations commonly arise where there are many more or less fragmentary witnesses, such
          that there may be quite distinct groups of witnesses for different parts of a text or
          collection of texts. One may treat this with distinct <gi>listWit</gi> elements for each
          different part. Alternatively, one may have a single <gi>listWit</gi> element at the
          beginning of the file or in its header listing all the witnesses, partial and complete,
          for the text, with the attestation of fragmentary witnesses indicated within the apparatus
          by use of the <gi>witStart</gi> and <gi>witEnd</gi> elements described in section <ptr target="#TCAPMI"/>.</p>
        <p>If a witness list is provided, it may be unnecessary to give, in each apparatus entry, an
          exhaustive list of the witnesses which agree with the base text. An application program
          can—in principle—compare the witnesses given for each variant found with those given in
          the full list of witnesses, subtracting from this list all the witnesses not active at
          this point (perhaps because of lacuna, or because they contain a variation on a different,
          overlapping lemma) and thence calculate all the manuscripts agreeing with the base text.
          In practice, encoders may find it less error-prone to list all witnesses explicitly in
          each apparatus entry.</p>

      <head>Fragmentary Witnesses</head>
      <p>If a witness is incomplete (whether a single fragment, a series of fragments, or a
        relatively complete text with one or more lacunae), it is usually desirable to record
        explicitly where its preserved portions begin and end. The following empty tags, which may
        occur within any <gi>lem</gi> or <gi>rdg</gi> element, indicate the beginning or end of a
        fragmentary witness or of a lacuna within a witness: <specList>
          <specDesc key="witStart"/>
          <specDesc key="witEnd"/>
          <specDesc key="lacunaStart"/>
          <specDesc key="lacunaEnd"/>
        </specList> These elements constitute the class <ident type="class">model.rdgPart</ident>,
        members of which are permitted within the elements <gi>lem</gi> and <gi>rdg</gi> when the
        module defined by this chapter is included in a schema.</p>
      <p>Suppose a fragment of a manuscript X of the <title>Wife of Bath's Prologue</title> has a
        physical lacuna, and the text of the manuscript begins with
        <mentioned>auctorite</mentioned>. In an apparatus this might appear thus, distinguished from
        the reading of other manuscripts by the presence of the <gi>lacunaEnd</gi> element:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
   <lem wit="#El #Hg">Auctoritee</lem>
   <rdg wit="#La #Ra2">auctorite</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#X"><lacunaEnd/>auctorite</rdg>
</app></egXML>
        Alternatively, it may be clearer to record this as
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>
   <lem wit="#El #Hg">Auctoritee</lem>
   <rdg wit="#La #Ra2 #X"><lacunaEnd wit="#X"/>auctorite</rdg>
</app></egXML>
        since this shows more clearly that the lacuna and the reading of <q>auctorite</q> both
        appear in witness X. In some cases, the apparatus in the source may commence recording the
        readings for a particular witness without its being clear whether the previous absence of
        readings for this witness is due to a lacuna, or to some other reason. The <gi>witStart</gi>
        element may be used in this circumstance:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app>

<!-- MDH 2012-08-06: Added information about the new <listApp> element.   -->
    <p>Where an <term>external</term> apparatus is used, the <gi>listApp</gi> element 
    provides a useful means of grouping together a series of <gi>app</gi> elements of a specific type,
    or from a particular source:
      <specList>

        <specDesc key="att.typed" atts="type subtype"/>
      </specList>
      
      <gi>listApp</gi> elements would normally appear in the <gi>back</gi> of 
    a document, but they may also be placed in any other convenient location.</p>
    
    <p>Any document containing <gi>app</gi> elements requires a <gi>variantEncoding</gi> declaration
      in the <gi>encodingDesc</gi> element of its TEI header, thus: <specList>
        <specDesc key="variantEncoding" atts="method location"/>
      </specList></p>

    <div type="div3" xml:id="TCAPLO">
      <head>The Location-referenced Method</head>
      <p>The location-referenced method of encoding apparatus provides a convenient method for
        encoding printed apparatus; in this method as in most printed editions, the apparatus is
        linked to the base text by indicating explicitly only the block of text on which there is a
        variant (noted usually by a canonical reference scheme, or by line number in the edition,
        such as <val>A 137</val> or <mentioned>Page 15 line 1</mentioned>).</p>
      <p>If the location-referenced method is used for an apparatus stored externally to the base
        text, the TEI header must have the declaration:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" source="#UND"><variantEncoding method="location-referenced" location="external"/></egXML></p>
      <p>In the <gi>body</gi> of the document, the base text (here El) will appear:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text>
  <body> 
    <div n="WBP" type="prologue">
      <head>The Prologe of the Wyves Tale of Bathe</head>
      <l n="1">Experience though noon Auctoritee</l>
      <l>Were in this world ...</l>
    </div>
  </body>
</text></egXML></p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the document, or in a separate file, the apparatus will appear. On each
          <gi>app</gi> element, the <att>loc</att> attribute should be specified to indicate where
        the variant occurs in the base text.
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app loc="WBP 1">
   <rdg wit="#La">Experiment</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
</app></egXML></p>
      <p>If the same text is encoded using in-line storage, the apparatus is dispersed through the
        base text block to which it refers. In this case, the location of the variant can be read
        from the line in which it occurs.
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><variantEncoding method="location-referenced" location="internal"/>
<!-- ... -->
<l n="1">Experience
  <app>
    <rdg wit="#La">Experiment</rdg>
    <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
  </app>
  though noon Auctoritee</l>
<l>Were in this world ...</l></egXML></p>
      <p>Since the location is not required to be exact, the apparatus for a line might also appear
        at the end of the line:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l n="1">Experience though noon Auctoritee
  <app>
    <rdg wit="#La"> Experiment</rdg>
    <rdg wit="#Ra2"> Eryment</rdg>
  </app></l>
<l>Were in this world ...</l></egXML></p>
      <p>When the apparatus is linked to the text by means of location references, as shown here, it
        is not possible to find automatically the precise portion of text varied by the readings. In
        order to show explicitly what portion of the base text is replaced by the variant readings,
        the <gi>lem</gi> element may be used:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l n="1">Experience though noon Auctoritee
  <app>
    <lem wit="#El">Experience</lem>
    <rdg wit="#La">Experiment</rdg>
    <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
  </app></l>
<l>Were in this world ...</l></egXML>
        Often the lemma will have no attributes, being simply the <soCalled>base text
          reading</soCalled> and requiring no qualification, but it may optionally carry the normal
        attributes, as shown here. Some text critics prefer to abbreviate or elide the lemma, in
        order to save space or trouble; such practice is not forbidden by these Guidelines, but no
        recommendations are made for conventions of abbreviating the lemma, whether abbreviation of
        each word, or suppression of all but the first and last word, etc.</p>
      <p>Where it is intended that the apparatus be complete enough to allow the reconstruction of
        the witnesses (or at least of their non-orthographic variations), simple location-reference
        methods are unlikely to be as successful as the other two methods, which allow the
        unambiguous reconstruction of the lemma from the encoding.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="TCAPDE">
      <head>The Double End-Point Attachment Method</head>
      <p>In the double end-point attachment method, the beginning and end of the lemma in the base
        text are both explicitly indicated. It thus differs from the location-referenced method, in
        which only the larger span of text containing the lemma is indicated. Double end-point
        attachment permits unambiguous matching of each variant reading against its lemma. It or the
        parallel-segmentation method should be used in all cases where this is desired, for example
        where the apparatus is intended to enable full reconstruction of the text, or of the
        substantives, of every witness.</p>
      <p>When the double end-point attachment method is used, the <att>from</att> and <att>to</att>
        attributes of the <gi>app</gi> element are used to indicate the beginning and ending points
        of the reading in the base text: their values are identifiers which occur at the locations
        in question. If no other markup is present there, the beginning and ending points should be
        marked using the <gi>anchor</gi> element defined in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>. In cases
        where it is not possible to insert anchors within the base text (e.g. where the text is on a
        read-only medium) the beginning and end of the lemma may be indicated by using the
          <soCalled>indirect pointing</soCalled> mechanisms discussed in chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>. Explicit anchors are more likely to be reliable, and are therefore to be preferred.</p>
      <p>The double end-point attachment method may be used with in-line or external apparatus. In
        the latter case, the base text (here El) will appear with <gi>anchor</gi> elements inserted
        at every place where a variant begins or ends (unless some element with an identifier
        already begins or ends at that point):
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
    <variantEncoding method="double-end-point" location="external"/>
<!-- ... -->
      <div n="WBP" type="prologue"><head>The Prologe ... </head>
        <l n="1" xml:id="WBP.1">Experience<anchor xml:id="WBP-A2"/> though noon Auctoritee</l>
        <l>Were in this world ...</l> 
      </div> 
</egXML>
        The apparatus will be separately encoded:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app from="#WBP.1" to="#WBP-A2">
   <rdg wit="#La">Experiment</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
</app></egXML>
        No <gi>anchor</gi> element is needed at the beginning of the line, since the <att>from</att>
        attribute can use the identifier for the line as a whole; the lemma is assumed to run from
        the beginning of the element indicated by the <att>from</att> attribute, to the end of that
        indicated by the <att>to</att> attribute. If no value is given for <att>to</att>, the lemma
        runs from the beginning to the end of the element indicated by the <att>from</att>
        attribute.</p>
      <p>When the apparatus is encoded in-line, it is dispersed through the base text. Only the
        beginning of the lemma need be marked with an <gi>anchor</gi>, since the <gi>app</gi> is
        inserted at the end of the lemma, and itself therefore marks the end of the lemma.
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><variantEncoding method="double-end-point" location="internal"/>
<!-- ... -->
<l n="1" xml:id="wbp.1">Experience

   </app>
   though noon Auctoritee</l>
<l>Were in this world ...</l></egXML></p>
      <p>The lemma need not be repeated within the <gi>app</gi> element in this method, as it may be
        extracted reliably from the base text. If an exhaustive list of witnesses is available, it
        will also not be necessary to specify just which manuscripts agree with the base text to
        enable reconstruction of witnesses. An application will be able to determine the manuscripts
        that witness the base reading, by noting which witnesses are attested as having a variant
        reading, and inferring the base text reading for all others after adjusting for fragmentary
        witnesses and for witnesses carrying overlapping variant readings.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if it is desired to make an explicit record of the attestation of the base
        text, the <gi>lem</gi> element may be embedded within <gi>app</gi>, carrying the witnesses
        to the base. Thus
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app from="#WBP.1" to="#WBP-A2">
   <lem wit="#El #Hg">Experience</lem>
   <rdg wit="#La">Experiment</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
</app></egXML></p>
      <p>This method is designed to cope with <soCalled>overlapping lemmata</soCalled>. For example,
        at line 117 of the Wife of Bath's Prologue, the manuscripts Hg (Hengwrt), El (Ellesmere),
        and Ha4 (British Library Harleian 7334) read: <list type="gloss">
          <label>Hg</label>
          <item>And of so parfit wys a wight ywroght</item>
          <label>El</label>
          <item>And for what profit was a wight ywroght</item>
          <label>Ha4</label>
          <item>And in what wise was a wight ywroght</item>
        </list></p>
      <p>In this case, one might wish to record <mentioned>in what wise was</mentioned> in Ha4 as a
        single variant for <mentioned>of so parfit wys</mentioned> in Hg, and <mentioned>was a
          wight</mentioned> in El and Ha4 as a variant on <mentioned>wys a wight</mentioned> in Hg.
        This method can readily cope with such difficult situations, typically found in large and
        complex traditions:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l xml:id="WBP.117" n="117"> And
  <anchor xml:id="WBP-A117.1"/> of so parfit

  </app>
  <app from="#WBP-A117.2" to="#WBP-A117.4">
    <lem wit="#Hg">wys a wight</lem>
    <rdg wit="#El #Ha4">was a wight</rdg>
  </app></l></egXML>
        The parallel segmentation method, to be discussed next, cannot handle overlaps among
        variants, and would require the individual variants to be split into pieces.</p>
      <p>Because creation and interpretation of double end-point attachment apparatus will be
        lengthy and difficult it is likely that they will usually be created and examined by
        scholars only with mechanical assistance.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="TCAPPS">
      <head>The Parallel Segmentation Method</head>
      <p>This method differs from the double end-point attachment method in that all variants at any
        point of the text are expressed as variants on one another. In this method, no two
        variations can overlap, although they may nest. The texts compared are divided into matching
        segments all synchronized with one another. This permits direct comparison of any span of
        text in any witness with that in any other witness. With a positive apparatus, it is
        straightforward for an application to extract the full text of any one witness from the
          apparatus.<note place="bottom">Some care must be taken with this approach, as a derived
          view of a witness may not be a complete and accurate transcription of that witness. It is
          more likely to be the base text with all readings from that witness applied.</note></p>
      <p>This method will (by definition) always be satisfactory when there are just two texts for
        comparison (assuming they are in the same language and script). It will however be less
        convenient for textual traditions where establishing a base text with variations from
        it is not a satisfactory goal for the edition, or in some cases where every detail of
        variation needs to be modeled.</p>
      <p>In the parallel segmentation method, each segment of text on which there is variation is
        marked by an <gi>app</gi> element. If there is a preferred (or base) reading it is tagged
        with <gi>lem</gi>; each reading is given in a <gi>rdg</gi> element: <egXML
          xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><variantEncoding method="parallel-segmentation"
            location="internal"/>
          <!-- ... -->

          <l>Were in this world ...</l></egXML></p>
      <p>This method cannot be used with external apparatus: it must be used in-line. Note that
        apparatus encoded with this method may be translated into the double end-point attachment
        method and back without loss of information. Where double-end-point-attachment encodings
        have no overlapping lemmata, translation of these to the parallel segmentation encoding and
        back will also be possible without loss of information.</p>

      <p>As noted, apparatus entries may nest in this method: if an imaginary fifth manuscript of
        the text read <mentioned>Auctoritee, though none experience</mentioned>, the variation on
        the individual words of the line would nest within that for the line as a whole: <egXML

      <p>Parallel segmentation cannot, however, deal very gracefully with variants which overlap

      <p> When an apparatus is provided it does not need to be given at the location in the
        transcription where the variation, emendation, attribution, or other apparatus observation
        occurs. Instead it may be stored in a separate place in the same file, or indeed in another
        file, and point to the location at which it is meant to be used. Storing apparatus entries
        separately can be beneficial when encoding multiple competing, potentially overlapping,
        interpretations of the same point in the source texts. </p>
      <p> The location-referenced method can be used to point a position in a text using the
          <att>loc</att> attribute and a canonical reference that is understood and documented in
        the context of the file where it is used. Where possible it is recommended that other
        methods use the <att>from</att> attribute to point to an <att>xml:id</att> attribute on an
          <gi>anchor</gi> or other element at the location where the apparatus observation takes
        place. The contents of an element pointed to are understood to be equivalent to a
          <gi>lem</gi> if none exists in the <gi>app</gi>, and if a <gi>lem</gi> does exist this
        should replace any content. </p>
      <p>The <att>from</att> attribute is a <ident type="datatype">teidata.pointer</ident> datatype and
        thus contains a URI as a value. This means that it can point directly to an
          <att>xml:id</att>, an <att>xml:id</att> in another local file, or indeed a file identified
        by any URL or URN.
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> 
    <l n="1"><seg xml:id="WBP-so.1.1">Experience</seg> though noon Auctoritee</l>
    
    <!-- In another file -->
    
    <app from="example.xml#WBP-so.1.1">
      <rdg wit="#La">Experiment</rdg>
      <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
    </app>
   </egXML>
        This could also be encoded as:
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> 
    <l n="1"><anchor xml:id="WBP-so.1.1a"/> though noon Auctoritee</l>
    
    <!-- In another file -->
    
    <app from="http://www.example.com/example.xml#WBP-so.1.1a">

      <rdg wit="#La">Experiment</rdg>
      <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
    </app>
   </egXML>
        However, this should be considered more fragile since a full reading of the <gi>lem</gi> is
        not provided in the source file. </p>
      <p> In addition, URLs can contain XPointer schemes including xpath(), range(), and
        string-range() which can be used in providing the location of an <gi>app</gi> that is stored
        separately from the text to which it applies. Both <att>from</att> and <att>to</att> can be
        used, as in the double end-point attachment method, to identify the starting and ending
        location for an apparatus using XPointer schemes described in <ptr target="#SATS"/> section
        to more precisely identify this location where beneficial.
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">     
        <l n="1" xml:id="WP.1a">Experience though noon Auctoritee</l>
        
        <!-- In another file -->

          <rdg wit="#Ra2">Eryment</rdg>
        </app>
   </egXML>
      </p>
      <p>If only the <att>from</att> attribute is provided then it should be understood that this
        supplies the location of the textual variance that the apparatus documents. If the
          <att>from</att> attribute contains an XPointer scheme that identifies a range of text (or
        elements) then this is understood to record the starting and ending of the range as in the
        double end-point attachment method. In such a case a @to attribute is unnecessary. </p>

  <div type="div2" xml:id="TCTR">
    <head>Using Apparatus Elements in Transcriptions</head>
    <p>It is often desirable to record different transcriptions of one stretch of text. These
      variant transcriptions may be grouped within a single <gi>app</gi> element. An application may
      then construct different <soCalled>views</soCalled> of the transcription by extraction of the
      appropriate variant readings from the apparatus elements embedded in the transcription.</p>
    <p>For example, alternative expansions can be recorded in several different <gi>expan</gi>
      elements, all grouped within an <gi>app</gi> element. Consider, for example, the three
      different transcriptions given below of line 105 of the Hengwrt manuscript of Chaucer's
        <title>The Wife of Bath's Prologue</title>. The last word of the line <mentioned>Virginite
        is grete perfection</mentioned> is written <mentioned>perfectio</mentioned> followed by two
      minims over which a bar has been drawn, which has been read in different ways by different
      scholars. The first transcription, by Elizabeth Solopova, represents the two minims with bar
      above as a special composite character using the <gi>g</gi> element. This transcription notes
      this as a mark of abbreviation but gives no expansion for it. A second transcriber, F. J.
      Furnivall, regards the bar as an abbreviation of <mentioned>u</mentioned>, and therefore reads
      the two minims as an <mentioned>n</mentioned>. A third transcriber, P. G. Ruggiers, regards
      the bar as an abbreviation of <mentioned>n</mentioned>, reading the minims as
        <mentioned>u</mentioned>. This information may be held within an <gi>app</gi> structure, as
      follows:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Virginite is grete
<app>
  <rdg source="#ES">perfectio<am><g ref="#ii"/></am></rdg>
  <rdg source="#FJF">perfectio<ex>u</ex>n</rdg>
  <rdg source="#PGR">perfectiou<ex>n</ex></rdg>
</app></egXML>
      This example uses special purpose elements <gi>am</gi> and <gi>ex</gi> used to represent
      abbreviation marks and editorial expansion respectively; these elements are provided by the
        <ident type="module">transcr</ident> module documented in chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>, which
      should be consulted for further discussion of methods of representing multiple readings of a
      source.
      <!-- This example illustrates the adaptation of the <gi>rdg</gi> aelement for
use within the transcription of a particular witness.  The
<att>wit</att> attribute, which may be compulsory in recording variant
readings of many witnesses within a critical apparatus, is redundant
when recording variant readings relating to a single witness.  However,
it may be desirable to specify the editorial responsibility for a
particular reading within a transcription.  For all three readings, the
<att>resp</att> attribute on <gi>rdg</gi> assigns this responsibility.
Using this system, it will be straightforward for an application to
extract from the one file the three different transcriptions done by
these scholars.  To do this, the application need look only at the
<att>resp</att> attribute on each <gi>rdg</gi> element.</p>
<p>Observe too that in this example the <att>resp</att> attribute is
attached to the outer <gi>rdg</gi> element and is not repeated for the
inner <gi>expan</gi> elements.  There is no need for repetition of the
<att>resp</att> attribute values, as the <gi>expan</gi> elements
contained within each <gi>rdg</gi> element will inherit the value of the
<att>resp</att> from the outer <gi>rdg</gi> element.  Thus, the
processor will know that the responsibility for the expansion
<mentioned>perfectioun</mentioned> lies with <ident>FJF</ident>, as
<ident>FJF</ident> was responsible for the reading containing this expansion.
This simplifies the processing of the information, as the application
has only to look at the attribute values for each reading in turn and
not for those for elements nested within.--></p>
    <p>Editorial notes may also be attached to <gi>app</gi> structures within transcriptions. Here,
      editorial preference for Ruggiers' expansion and an explanation of that preference is given:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Virginite is grete
<app>
  <rdg source="#ES">perfecti<am><g ref="#ii"/></am></rdg>
  <rdg xml:id="f105" source="#FJF">perfectio<ex>u</ex>n</rdg>
  <rdg xml:id="r105" source="#PGR">perfectiou<ex>n</ex></rdg>
</app>
<!-- ... <note> appearing elsewhere in the document ... -->
<note target="#r105 #f105">Furnivall's expansion implies that the bar
  is an abbreviation for 'u'. There are no certain instances of
  this mark as an abbreviation for 'u' in these manuscripts and it is
  widely used as an abbreviation for 'n'. Ruggiers' expansion is to
  be accepted.</note></egXML>
    </p>
    <p>In most cases, elements used to indicate features of a primary textual source may be
      represented within an <gi>app</gi> structure simply by nesting them within its readings, just
      as the <gi>am</gi> and <gi>ex</gi> elements are nested within the <gi>rdg</gi> elements in the
      example just given. However, in cases where the tagged feature extends across a span of text
      which might itself contain variant readings which it is desired to represent by <gi>app</gi>
      structures, some adaptation of the tagging may be necessary. For example, a span of text may
      be marked in the transcription of the primary source as a single deletion but it may be
      desirable to represent just a few words from this source as individual deletions within the
      context of a critical apparatus drawing together readings from this and several other
      witnesses. In this case, the tagging of the span of words as one deletion may need to be
      decomposed into a series of one-word deletions for encoding within the apparatus. If it is
      important to record the fact that all were deleted by the same act, the markup may use the
        <gi>join</gi> element or the <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> attributes defined by
      chapter <ptr target="#SA"/>.</p>

  <div>
    <head>Strategies for Encoding Variation</head>
    <p>Textual variation may manifest itself in many ways. Variation most frequently occurs at the phrase level,
      but is also common at higher structural levels, such as the verse line, paragraph, or chapter. When
      these structures are involved, some care must be taken in their encoding to ensure that TEI's
      Abstract Model is not being broken. It would be an error, for example, to have a <gi>div</gi> in
      the <gi>lem</gi>, but a <gi>p</gi> in a <gi>rdg</gi> inside the same apparatus entry, because these 
      structures cannot occur at the same level. Similarly, it is an error if the contents of an 
      apparatus entry place a <gi>p</gi> inside another <gi>p</gi> or an <gi>l</gi> inside an <gi>l</gi>.</p>
    <p>Phenomena such as omissions and transpositions in witnesses will require some encoding strategies
      that differ from those in the examples above. An editor wishing to signal an omission in one witness 
      should encode the omission using an empty <gi>rdg</gi>, thus:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app xml:id="d1e372">
  <lem xml:id="d1e373" source="#Heyworth"><l n="18">Hypsipyle uacuo constitit in thalamo:</l></lem>
  <rdg xml:id="d1e376" wit="#J" cause="homeoarchon"/>
</app></egXML>
      Notice that in this example, the variation occurs at the unit of the verse line. The scribe of MS J has 
      skipped line 18 (probably by mistake) because, like line 19, it begins with the name "Hypsipyle." If a witness 
      contains an interpolation that the editor does not wish to show in the base text, an empty
      <gi>lem</gi> should be used, in the same fashion.
    </p>
    <p>Transpositions are harder to encode, because they involve variation that occurs in different 
      locations. A single <gi>app</gi> will therefore not be sufficient, and the variants must be linked. 
      For example, in his edition of Propertius 1.16, Housman printed lines 25-6 after line 32, Heyworth prints 
      them in place. We might encode Heyworth's edition, which records Housman's conjecture despite disagreeing 
      with it, as follows:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app xml:id="app-lem-l25-l26" exclude="#app-rdg-Housman-l25-26">
  <lem xml:id="d1e462" source="#Heyworth">
    <l n="25" xml:id="l25">desine iam reuocare tuis periuria verbis,</l>
    <l n="26" xml:id="l26">Cynthia, et oblitos parce movere deos;</l>
  </lem>
</app></egXML> and then, after line 32:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app xml:id="app-rdg-Housman-l25-26" exclude="#app-lem-l25-l26">
  <rdg xml:id="d1e603" source="#Housman">
    <l copyOf="#l25"/>
    <l copyOf="#l26"/>
  </rdg>
  <note target="#d1e603">Housman put these lines after 32.</note>
</app></egXML>
      Note that both <gi>app</gi>s are linked via the <att>exclude</att> attribute, because they are mutually
      exclusive: if one reading is chosen for display in a reading interface, for example, the other must 
      disappear and vice versa. To avoid repetition, the second pair of lines can make use of the <att>copyOf</att> 
      attribute. If they were both transposed and somewhat different, then both sets should be written in full.
    </p>
    <p>Apparatus entries may nest when there is variation at both higher and lower structural levels, e.g.:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><app xml:id="d1e275">
  <lem xml:id="d1e277" source="#Heyworth">
    <l n="8"><app xml:id="d1e280"><lem xml:id="d1e281" wit="#N #Λ">ut</lem><rdg xml:id="d1e283" wit="#A">et</rdg><rdg xml:id="d1e285" source="#Nodell">ac</rdg> <note target="#d1e287">perhaps</note><rdg xml:id="d1e287" source="#Heyworth" cert="low">quam</rdg></app> formosa nouo quae parat ire uiro.</l>
    <l n="9"><app xml:id="d1e294"><lem xml:id="d1e295">at</lem><rdg xml:id="d1e297" wit="#A">et</rdg></app> non sic, Ithaci digressu <app xml:id="d1e300"><lem xml:id="d1e301">mota</lem><rdg xml:id="d1e303" source="#Graevius">immota</rdg></app>, Calypso</l>
    <l n="10">desertis olim fleuerat aequoribus:</l>
    <l n="11">multos illa dies incomptis maesta capillis</l>
  </lem>
  <rdg xml:id="d1e314" wit="#C" cause="homoeoteleuton"/><note target="#d1e314">omits lines 8-11 because of homoeoteleuton.</note>
</app></egXML>
      Here, MS C omits lines 8-11, but there are variations the editor wishes to record in the other witnesses 
      which do have these lines. Therefore, an outer <gi>app</gi> gives the lines in the <gi>lem</gi> and the
      omission in a <gi>rdg</gi>. Further variation is encoded for lines 8 and 9 using nested <gi>app</gi>s.
