<h1 class="SECT1"><a name="AEN1250">Some general remarks on DTDs
and catalogs</a></h1>

<p>For first-time users it is often hard to understand how DTDs,
catalog files, OpenJade/onsgmls, and PSGML interact, and to
understand what is wrong when they refuse to interact properly.
This section briefly describes the general setup of DTDs, before we
will install the DocBook DTD and HTML DTDs as examples.</p>

<p>When we installed the <span class="APPLICATION">SP suite</span>,
we created an environment variable called <tt class=
"ENVAR">SGML_CATALOG_FILES</tt>. This is simply the full path of a
catalog file or a list of such full paths. It is mainly a matter of
taste whether you use one catalog file or more. Using one catalog
file keeps all information in one place, but it requires more
manual work if you add or update DTDs. So you might guess that
catalog files keep some information about DTDs. This is correct,
but how does it exactly work then?</p>

<p>In the simple example file <tt class="FILENAME">test.sgml</tt>
that you created initially, we wrote a small SGML document that
carried its document type definition at the beginning of the
document file. This is fine for small and custom DTDs, but it is
inefficient if many documents use the same DTD. Therefore SGML
allows to keep the DTDs in separate files and to reference these
external files at the beginning of a SGML document. This reference
may look like this:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
      
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "html.dtd"&gt;
      
   
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This translates to: The document type of this document is <i
class="WORDASWORD">HTML</i>, and the DTD which describes this
document type is available on the local system in a file called <tt
class="FILENAME">html.dtd</tt>. It is assumed that <tt class=
"FILENAME">html.dtd</tt> is in the same directory as the document.
This basically works fine, but has one major drawback: These
documents are not easily portable.</p>

<p>The use of catalog files overcomes this limitation. The
corresponding prolog may look like this:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
      
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"&gt;
      
   
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This translates to: The document type of this document is <i
class="WORDASWORD">HTML</i>, and the DTD has the formal public
identifier <i class="WORDASWORD">-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN</i>.
This is where catalog files come into play. It is expected that a
catalog file (accessible via the <tt class=
"ENVAR">SGML_CATALOG_FILES</tt> environment variable) has an entry
which resolves this identifier to a local file. The corresponding
entry in a catalog file might look like this:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
      
      PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN" "html/html.dtd"
      
   
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This now translates to: The DTD which is referenced with the
formal public identifier <i class="WORDASWORD">-//IETF//DTD HTML
2.0//EN</i> is stored locally in the file <tt class=
"FILENAME">html.dtd</tt>. The exact path of this file is always
relative to the catalog file. In this example the file <tt class=
"FILENAME">html.dtd</tt> can be found in the <tt class=
"FILENAME">html</tt> subdirectory of the directory that contains
the catalog file.</p>

<p>Taken together, the idea of installing a DTD on the local system
is to:</p>

<div class="PROCEDURE">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Put the DTD file(s) in some directory</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Provide a new or edit an existing catalog file which resolves
the identifier to a local file</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Make the catalog file accessible via the <tt class=
"ENVAR">SGML_CATALOG_FILES</tt> environment variable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>The procedure described so far will enable <span class=
"APPLICATION">openade</span>, <span class=
"APPLICATION">onsgmls</span>, and PSGML to access DTDs via catalog
files. Before a DTD can be used, it has to be parsed to create a
representation in the memory. This parsing can take quite a long
time, which is especially a problem with PSGMLS: the internal
parser is implemented in the interpreted language Emacs Lisp.
Therefore PSGML provides a mechanism to store a memory
representation of a parsed DTD in a separate file and read this
instead of the original DTD. Just as the original DTDs, the
pre-parsed DTDs can be accessed via catalog files as well. As only
PSGML uses this kind of DTD, there is no environment variable to
locate these catalog files. This is set in the <tt class=
"FILENAME">_emacs</tt> file instead. The basic steps to make use of
this PSGML feature are:</p>

<div class="PROCEDURE">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Load a document that uses the DTD (or create a new, empty one)
and parse the DTD with PSGML</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Save the parsed DTD with PSGML into the directory that contains
the DTD</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Create or edit a catalog file (usually called <tt class=
"FILENAME">ecatalog</tt> to distinguish it from regular catalog
files) which resolves the DTD identifier to the parsed DTD.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Modify your <tt class="FILENAME">_emacs</tt> to tell PSGML where
the <tt class="FILENAME">ecatalog</tt> files can be found.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Now, whenever you open or create a SGML document, PSGML first
checks whether a parsed version of the given DTD exists and uses it
if present. If no parsed version exists, it uses the DTD itself and
saves a parsed version for the next time you open a file with this
DTD. Whether or not the additional hassle with ecatalog files pays
off depends on the speed of your computer and the size of the DTDs
that you use.</p>

<p>We will now go ahead and use this knowledge to install a few
useful DTDs.</p>
