  <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment</head>
  <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This chapter discusses a number of ways in which encoders may
  represent analyses of the structure of a text which are not
  necessarily linear or hierarchic. The module defined by this chapter
  provides for the following common requirements:
  <list type="bullets">
    <item>to <emph>link</emph> disparate elements 
    using the <att>xml:id</att> attribute (section <ptr target="#SAPT"/>);</item>
    <item>to link disparate elements without using the
    <att>xml:id</att> attribute (sections <ptr target="#SAUR"/>, <ptr target="#SAES"/>, and <ptr target="#SATS"/>);</item>
    <item>to <emph>segment</emph> text into elements convenient for
    the encoder and to mark arbitrary points within documents (section
    <ptr target="#SASE"/>);</item>
    <item>to represent <term>correspondence</term> or
    <term>alignment</term> among groups of text elements, both those
    with content and those which are empty (section <ptr target="#SACS"/>);<note place="foot">We use the term alignment as a
    special case of the more general notion of correspondence. Using A
    as a short form for <q>an element with its attribute <att>xml:id</att>
    set to the value <val>A</val></q>, and suppose elements A1, A2,
    and A3 occur in that order and form one group, while elements B1,
    B2, and B3 occur in that order and form another group. Then a
    relation in which A1 corresponds to B1, A2 corresponds to B2, and
    A3 corresponds to B3 is an alignment. On the other hand, a
    relation in which A1 corresponds to B2, B1 to C2, and C1 to A2 is
    not an alignment.</note></item>
    <item>to <term rend="noindex">synchronize</term> elements of a
    text, that is to represent temporal correspondences and alignments
    among text elements (section <ptr target="#SASY"/>) and also to
    align them with specific points in time (section <ptr target="#SASYMP"/>);</item>
    <item>to specify that one text element is <emph>identical</emph>
    to or a <emph>copy</emph> of another (section <ptr target="#SAIE"/>);</item>
    <item>to <emph>aggregate</emph> possibly noncontinguous elements
    (section <ptr target="#SAAG"/>);</item>
    <item>to specify that different elements are
    <emph>alternatives</emph> to one another and to express
    <emph>preferences</emph> among the alternatives (section <ptr target="#SAAT"/>);</item>
    <item>to store markup separately from the the data it describes (section <ptr target="#SASO"/>);</item>
    <item>to associate segments of a text
    with interpretations or analyses of their significance (section
    <ptr target="#SAAN"/>).</item>
  </list></p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">These facilities all use the same basic set of techniques, which
  are based on the W3C <ref>XPointer</ref> mechanism, which includes a
  variety of <term rend="noindex">schemes</term>. The most convenient
  technique, and that which is recommended by these Guidelines
  wherever possible, makes use of the global <att>xml:id</att>
  attribute, as defined in section <ptr target="#STGA"/>. For many of
  the topics discussed in this chapter, a choice of methods of
  encoding is offered, ranging from simple but less general ones,
  which use attribute values only, to more elaborate and more general
  ones, which use specialized elements.</p>
  <div type="div2" xml:id="SAPT">
    <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Links</head>
    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We say that one element <term rend="noindex">points</term> to
    others if the first has an attribute whose value is a reference to
    the others: such an element is called a <term>pointer
    element</term>, or simply a <term>pointer</term>. Among the
    pointers that have been introduced up to this point in these
    Guidelines are <gi>note</gi>, <gi>ref</gi>, and <gi>ptr</gi>.
    These elements all indicate an association between one place in
    the document (the location of the pointer itself) and one or more
    others (the elements whose identifiers are specified by the
    pointer's <att>target</att> attribute). This element set defines a
    variation on this basic kind of pointer, known as a
    <term>link</term> which specifies both <soCalled>ends</soCalled>
    of an association. In addition, we define a syntax for
    representing locations in a document by a variety of means not
    dependent on the use of <att>xml:id</att> attributes.</p>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="SAPTL">
      <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pointers and Links</head>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In section <ptr target="#COXR"/> we introduced the simplest
      pointer elements, <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi>. Here we
      introduce additionally the <gi>link</gi> element, which
      represents an association between two (or more) locations by
      specifying each location explicitly. Its own location is
      irrelevant to the intended linkage.
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="ptr" atts="target"/>
        <specDesc key="ref" atts="target"/>
        <specDesc key="link" atts="targets"/>
      </specList>
      The <gi>ptr</gi> element may be called a <soCalled>pure
      pointer</soCalled>, because its primary function is simply to
      point. A pointer sets up a <term rend="noindex">connection</term>
      between an element (which, in
      the case of a pure pointer, can be thought of simply as a
      location in a document), and one or more others, known
      collectively as its <term>target</term>. The <gi>ptr</gi> and
      <gi>ref</gi> elements bear a <att>target</att> attribute (in the
      singular), because they point, conceptually, at a single target,
      even if that target may be discontinuous in the document. The
      <gi>link</gi> element bears a <att>targets</att> attribute, with
      a plural name, because it specifies at least two targets, each
      of which is a unitary object. It may be thought of as a
      representing a <term>double link</term> between the objects
      specified.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As members of the class <ident type="class">att.pointing</ident>,
      these elements share a common set of attributes:
      <specList>
        <specDesc key="att.pointing" atts="type evaluate"/>
      </specList></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Double connection among elements could also be expressed by a
      combination of pointer elements, for example, two <gi>ptr</gi>
      elements, or one <gi>ptr</gi> element and one <gi>note</gi>
      element. All that is required is that the value of the
      <att>target</att> (or other pointing) attribute of the one be
      the value of the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the other. What
      the <gi>link</gi> element accomplishes is the handling of double
      connection by means of a single element. Thus, in the following
      encoding:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><ptr xml:id="sa-p1" target="#sa-p2"/><ptr xml:id="sa-p2" target="#sa-p1"/></egXML>
      <val>sa-p1</val> points to <val>sa-p2</val>, and <val>sa-p2</val>
      points to <val>sa-p1</val>. This is logically
      equivalent to the more compact encoding:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><link targets="#sa-p1 #sa-p2"/></egXML></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As noted above, elements pointed to or linked by this simple
      method must be identifiable using the global <att>xml:id</att>
      attribute. This implies that they must be present in the same
      document, and that they must bear unique <att>xml:id</att>
      values. Pointing or linking to external documents and pointing
      or linking where identifiers are not available is implemented by
      more complete forms of URI references, as described below in
      section <ptr target="#SAXP"/>.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="div3" xml:id="SAPTEG">
      <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Using Pointers and Links</head>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As an example of the use of these mechanisms which establish
      connections among elements, consider the practice (common in
      18th century English verse and elsewhere) of providing footnotes
      citing parallel passages from classical authors. <figure xml:id="POPE" rend="float fullpage">
      <graphic url="./dunpic.png"/><figDesc>The
      figure shows the original page of Pope's <title>Dunciad</title>
      which is discussed in the text.</figDesc></figure> Such
      footnotes can of course simply be encoded using the
      <gi>note</gi> element (see section <ptr target="#CONO"/>) without
      a <att>target</att> attribute, placed adjacent to the passage to
      which the note refers:<note place="foot">The <att>type</att>
      attribute on the note is used to classify the notes using the
      typology established in the Advertisement to the work: <q>The
      <term rend="noindex">Imitations</term> of the Ancients are
      added, to gratify those who either never read, or may have
      forgotten them; together with some of the Parodies, and
      Allusions to the most excellent of the Moderns.</q> In the
      source text, the text of the poem shares the page with two sets
      of notes, one headed <q>Remarks</q> and the other
      <q>Imitations</q>.</note>

      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This use of the <gi>note</gi> element can be called
      <term>implicit pointing</term> (or <term>implicit
      linking</term>). It relies on the juxtaposition of the note to
      the text being commented on for the connection to be understood.
      If it is felt that the mere juxtaposition of the note to the
      text does not make it sufficiently clear exactly what text
      segment is being commented on (for example, is it the
      immediately preceding line, or the immediately preceding two
      lines, or what?), or if it is decided to place the note at some
      distance from the text, then the pointing or the linking must be
      made explicit. We now consider various methods for doing
      that.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Firstly, a <gi>ptr</gi> element might be placed at an
      appropriate point within the text to link it with the
      annotation:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l>(Diff'rent our parties, but with equal grace</l><![CDATA[

      <l>—— Rex Jupiter omnibus idem.</l>
   </quote>
</note></egXML>
      <!-- Pope, Dunciad (1729) III.284 -->
      The <gi>note</gi> element has been given an arbitrary identifier
      (<val>note3.284</val>) to enable it to be specified
      as the target of the pointer element. Because there is nothing
      in the text to signal the existence of the annotation, the
      <att>rend</att> attribute has been given the value <val>unmarked</val>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Secondly, the <att>target</att> attribute of the
      <gi>note</gi> element can be used to point at its associated
      text, provided that an <att>xml:id</att> attribute has been
      supplied for the associated text:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l xml:id="l3.283">(Diff'rent our parties, but with equal grace</l><![CDATA[

]]><!-- ... --><![CDATA[
      ]]></egXML>
Given this encoding of the text itself, we can now link the various
notes to it. In this case, the note
      itself contains a pointer to the place in the text which it is
      annotating, this could be encoded using a <gi>ref</gi>
      element, which bears a <att>target</att> attribute of its own
      and contains a (slightly misquoted) extract from the text marked
      as a <gi>quote</gi> element:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><note type="imitation" place="foot" anchored="false" target="#l3.284">    
   <ref rend="sc" target="#l3.284">Verse 283–84.
       <quote>

   <quote>    
      <l>Tros Rutulusve fuat; nullo discrimine habebo.</l>
      <l>—— Rex Jupiter omnibus idem. </l>
   </quote>
</note></egXML>
      <!-- Pope, Dunciad (1729) III.284 --></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Combining these two approaches gives us the following
      associations:
      <list type="simple">
        <item>a pointer within one line indicates the note</item>
        <item>the note indicates the line</item>
        <item>a pointer within the note indicates the line</item>
      </list>
      Note that we do not have any way of pointing from the line
      itself to the note: the association is implied by containment of
      the pointer. We do not as yet have a true double link between
      text and note. To achieve that we will need to supply identifiers for
      the annotations as well as for the verse lines, and use a <gi>link</gi> element to associate the
      two. Note that the <gi>ptr</gi> element and the
      <att>target</att> attribute on the <gi>note</gi> may now be
      dispensed with:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[

      here bears the identifiers of the note followed by that of the
      verse line. For completeness, we could also allocate an
      identifier to the reference within the note and encode the
      association between it and the verse line in the same way:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><note xml:id="nt3.284" type="imitation" place="foot" anchored="false">

      Indeed, the two <gi>link</gi>s could be combined into one, as
      follows:

      <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Groups of Links</head>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clearly, there are many reasons for which an encoder might
      wish to represent a link or association between different
      elements. For some of them, specific elements are provided in
      these Guidelines; some of these are discussed elsewhere in the
      present chapter. The <gi>link</gi> element is a general purpose
      element which may be used for any kind of association. The
      element <gi>linkGrp</gi> may be used to group links of a
      particular type together in a single part of the document; such
      a collection may be used to represent what is sometimes referred
      to in the literature of Hypertext as a <term>web</term>, a term
      introduced by the Brown University FRESS project in 1969.
      <specList><specDesc key="linkGrp"/></specList>
      As a member of the class <ident type="class">att.pointing.group</ident>, this element shares the
      following attributes with other members of that class:
      <specList><specDesc key="att.pointing.group" atts="domains targFunc "/></specList>
      It is also a member of the <ident type="class">att.pointing</ident>
      class, and therefore also carries the attributes specified in
      section <ptr target="#SAPTL"/> above, in particular the
      <att>type</att> attribute:
      <specList><specDesc key="att.pointing" atts="type"/></specList></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>linkGrp</gi> element provides a convenient way of
      establishing a default for the <att>type</att> attribute on a
      group of links of the same type: by default, the <att>type</att>
      attribute on a <gi>link</gi> element has the same value as that
      given for <att>type</att> on the enclosing <gi>linkGrp</gi>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Typical software might hide a web entirely from the user, but
      use it as a source of information about links, which are
      displayed independently at their referenced locations.
      Alternatively, software might provide a direct view of the link
      collection, along with added functions for manipulating the
      collection, as by filtering, sorting, and so on.
      To continue our previous example, this text contains many other
      notes of a kind similar to the one shown above. Here are a few
      more of the lines to which annotations have to be attached,
      followed by the annotations themselves:

      containing the notes. Then the <att>domains</att> attribute can

      one could use the <att>target</att> and <att>targetEnd</att>
      attributes of the <gi>note</gi> element to delimit the span to
      which the note applies (see further section <ptr target="#CONO"/>). Alternatively one could create an element to

      attribute, which can then be linked to the <gi>note</gi> and
      <gi>ref</gi> elements. This could be done either explicitly by

      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A third possibility however, is to use an

      some way to produce the object of the pointer. (Such aggregation
      is however the task of a processing application, and cannot be
      defined simply by the mark-up). The <att>xml:id</att> attribute
      provides an identifier which can then be linked to the

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><link evaluate="all" targets="#n3.284 #r3.284 #l3.283284"/></egXML>

    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This section introduces more formally the pointing mechanisms
    available in the TEI. In addition to those
    discussed so far, the TEI provides methods of pointing:
    <list>
      <item>into documents other than the current document;</item>
      <item>to a particular element in a document other than the
      current document using its <att>xml:id</att>;</item>
      <item>to a particular element whether in the current document or
      not, using its position in the XML element tree;</item>
      <item>at arbitrary content in any XML document using TEI-defined
      XPointer schemes.</item>
    </list>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">All TEI attributes used to point at something else are declared
    as having the datatype <ident>att.pointer</ident>, which is
    defined as a URI reference<note place="foot">The URI (Universal
    Resource Indicator)  is defined in <ref target="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC2396</ref></note>;
    the cases so far discussed are all simple examples of a URI
    reference. Another familiar example is the mechanism used in  HTML to create
    represent hypertext links by means of the <att>href</att>
    attribute. A URI reference can reference
a single XML resource such as a document or an XML element, but also a
    sub-portion of it  identified by means of an
    appropriate <term>fragment identifier</term>. Technically
    speaking, the
    <soCalled>fragment identifier</soCalled> is that portion of a URI
    reference following the first unescaped <q>#</q> character; in
    practice, it provides a means of accessing some part of the
    resource described by the URI which is less than the whole.  <!-- The
    details of the interpretation of the Fragment-ID depend on the
    Internet MIME-type of the resource identified by the URI. --></p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The first three of the following subsections provide only a
    brief overview and some examples of the W3C mechanisms

    mechanisms is readily available elsewhere.<!-- where? --></p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Like the ubiquitous if misnamed HTML pointing attribute <att scheme="HTML">href</att>, the TEI pointing attributes can point
      to a document that is not the current document (the one that
      contains the pointing element) whether it is in the same local
      filesystem as the current document, or on a different system
      entirely. In either case, the pointing can be accomplished
      absolutely (using the entire address of the target document) or
      relatively (using an address relative to the current base URI in
      force). The <soCalled>current base URI</soCalled> is defined
      according to the W3C <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/">XML Base</ref>
      recommendation. <!-- This recommendation defines an
      <att>xml:base</att> attribute that may be inserted into XML
      documents in order to make references more manageable. --> In
      general the current base URI in force is the value of the
      <att>xml:base</att> attribute of the closest ancestor that has one. If
      there is none, the base URI is that of the current document.
<!-- The current base URI in force is as defined in the W3C

      one, or if there are none, the URI of the location of the current document.-->

      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The following example demonstrates an absolute URI reference
      that points to a remote document: <!--. It is the source code for the

      accessible via HTTP, the web Protocol. Suppose however that wish
      to access a document stored locally in a file. Again we will
      supply an absolute URI reference, but this time using a
      different protocol:

Since no xml:base is specified here, the location of the resource
<ident>Figures/compic.png</ident> is determined relative to the
resource indicated by the current base URI, which is the current
document.
</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In the following example, however, we first change the current base
      URI by setting a new value for xml:base. The resource required

This method of pointing, by referring to the <att>xml:id</att> of the

the simplest and often the best approach where it can be applied, i.e. where
both the source element and target element are in the same XML

      Scheme</ref>.</note> In this scheme, an element may be identified by

      numbers. For each step the integer <code>n</code> locates the
      <hi>n</hi>th child element of the previously located
      element. Thus a pointer such as <code>&lt;ptr

      child element starting from the root element of the document

      (or, perhaps more usefully,
      xpath1(/PLAY[1]/ACT[3]/SCENE[1]/SPEECH[19]/LINE[1])) selects the
      element <q><![CDATA[<LINE>To be, or not to be: that is the
      question:</LINE>]]></q>.</note> -->
      The  URI  in this example references an XML resource assumed to be
      available via the HTTP protocol on the web; within
      that file, the specified <name type="xpscheme">element</name>
      scheme is used to select  <q>the first (root-level)  element's 8th
      child element's 2nd child element's 25th child element's 2nd
      child element</q>. This is equivalent to the XPath
      specification <code>/*[1]/*[8]/*[2]/*[25]/*[2]</code>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Rather than specifying a full path starting from the document
      root, it is also possible in this pointer scheme to specify as
      starting point any element which carries a value for its
      <att>xml:id</att> attribute, supplying a unique identifier for
      it.  In this case the identifier is prefixed to the location
      path. For example, we can point more economically to the same
      line of Hamlet in a different digital version of the play which
      provides identifiers for the individual scenes: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div xml:base="/Users/martin/Documents/c5/namelessShakespeare.xml"><p><ptr target="#element(sha-ham301/22/2)"/></p></div></egXML> Here the
      identifier <val>sha-ham301</val> is the identifier for the
      <gi>div</gi> element containing Act III, Scene I of Hamlet. The
      second child of the 22nd child of this <gi>div</gi> element
      contains the desired <gi>l</gi> element. This is equivalent to
      the XPath specfication
      <code>id(sha-ham301)/*[22]/*[2]</code>.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As noted above, we could also point directly to this line if it had an
identifier of its own. In another digital edition of Shakespeare,
based on the first folio, each
line is given an identifier based on its <soCalled>through line
number</soCalled>. Our pointer to this line can now be represented
simply as <gi>ptr target="#element(Ham01245)"/</gi>, or even more
simply as <gi>ptr target="#Ham01245"/</gi>. The notation <gi>ptr
target="#xxx"/</gi> is a convenient abbreviation for  <gi>ptr
target="#element(xxx)"/</gi>. This method requires, of course, that
the through line number is supplied as the value of an
<att>xml:id</att> attribute on each line, and must therefore be unique
within each document. In
section <ptr target="#SACR"/> we discuss a method of pointing to the
line which does not have this requirement.  </p>

      <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">TEI XPointer Schemes</head>

      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The pointing scheme described in this chapter is one of a
      number of such schemes envisaged by the W3C, which together
      constitute a framework for addressing data within XML documents,
      known as the <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/">XPointer
      Framework</ref>. This framework permits the definition of many
      other named addressing methods, each of which is known as an
      <term>XPointer Scheme</term>. The W3C has pre-defined a set of
      such schemes, and maintains a register for their expansion. The
      <name type="xpscheme">element</name> scheme described above is
      one such scheme, defined by the W3C, and widely implemented  by
      XML processing systems.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Another important scheme, also defined by the W3C, and recommended
by these Guidelines is the <name type="xpscheme">xpath1</name> pointer
scheme, which allows for any part of an XML structure to be selected
using the syntax defined by the Xpath specification. This is further
discussed below, <ptr target="#SATSXP"/>. These Guidelines also define
five other pointer schemes, which provide access to parts of an XML
document such as points within  data content or stretches of data
content. These additional TEI pointer schemes are defined in sections
<ptr target="#SATSLR"/> to <ptr target="#SATSMA"/> below. </p>

<div type="div4"><head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Introduction to TEI pointers</head>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Before discussing the TEI pointer schemes, we introduce
slightly more formally the terminology used to define them. So far, we
have discussed only ways of pointing at components of the XML
information set node such as elements and attributes. However, there
is often a need in text analysis to address additional types of
location such as the <soCalled>point</soCalled> locations
<emph>between</emph> nodes, and <soCalled>ranges</soCalled> that may
arbitrarily cross the boundaries of nodes in a document.  The content
of an XML document is organized sequentially as well as
hierarchically, and it therefore makes sense to consider ranges of
characters within it independently of the nodes to which they belong,
for example when making a selection in a text editor. For processing
purposes, such a range is best defined by the pair of points at its
start and end.  It is often useful to think of pointer schemes as
analogous to query functions that return nodes in the XML information
set (the DOM tree) of an
XML document, as in the case of the element and xpath pointer schemes
discussed so far, but this is not invariably the case. A point is
adjacent to one or two nodes, but is not a node itself, while a range
may not even overlap with any complete node in the DOM tree.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The TEI pointer scheme thus distinguishes the following
kinds of object:

<list>
        <label>Node</label>
	<item>A node represents a single item in the XML information
	set for a document. For pointing
	purposes, the only nodes that are of interest are Text Nodes,
	Element Nodes, and Attribute nodes.</item> <!-- why not
	comments ? -->
        <label>Node Set</label>
	<item>A node set is a set of nodes in the XML information set  of a
	document. In TEI Pointing applications, node sets are only
	allowed as the result of resolving a URI when multiple URIs
	would have been allowed where it appears, i.e. in attributes
	which are declared as <name type="datatype">data.pointers</name> as opposed to <name type="datatype">data.pointer</name>. As  the name
	<soCalled>set,</soCalled> implies, the individual items in a node set
	are not ordered, and no assumptions about relative ordering of
	items in a node set should be made.</item>
        <label>Point</label>
	<item>A Point represents a point between nodes in a document.
	Every point is adjacent to either characters or elements, and
	never to another point. In fact, in the character
	representation of an XML document, every position between data
	characters, start-tags or end-tags is a point, and there are
	no other points. 
   If one treats all character content as if it were broken into
   single-character text-nodes, every point is definable as either
<list>
<item> the point preceding a node, and if that node has a predecessor
     in document order, then it is the same as the point following
     that predecessor; or</item>
<item> the point following a node, and if that node has a successor in
     document order, then it is the same as the point preceding that
     successor.
</item></list>
</item>
        <label>Range</label>
	<item>A Range is defined as the portion of a document between
	two points. Since points may occur anywhere within the
	document, ranges do not correspond directly to nodes or to node
	sets. A range may overlap the contents of a node either
	completely or partially.</item>
      </list>
      </p>


     <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The TEI has registered the following five pointer schemes:

        When the URI reference is specified as the value of an

        <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Worked Example</head>
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Let us presume that with the example <gi>refsDecl</gi>
        above, an application comes across a <att>cRef</att> value of
        <val>Matt 5:7</val> inside a <gi>div</gi> which has an
        <att>xml:base</att> of
        <val>http://www.jph.org/resources/books/Bible.xml</val>. The
        application would first apply the regular expression
        <code>(.+) (.+):(.+)</code> to <q>Matt 5:7</q>. This regular
        expression would successfully match. The first matched
        substring would be <q>Matt</q>, the second <q>5</q>, and the
        third <q>7</q>. The application would then apply these
        substrings to the pattern
        <code>#xpath1(//div[@n='$1']/div[$2]/div[$3])</code>, producing
        <code>#xpath1(//div[@n='Matt']/div[5]/div[7])</code>. It would
        append this to the <att>xml:base</att> in force, thus
        generating the complete URI Reference
        <code>http://www.jph.org/resources/books/Bible.xml#xpath1(//div[@n='Matt']/div[5]/div[7])</code>.
        </p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">If, however, the input string had been <q>Matt 5</q>, the
        first regular expression would not have matched. The
        application would have then tried the second, <code>(.+)
        (.+)</code>, producing a successful match, and the matched
        substrings <q>Matt</q> and <q>5</q>. It would then have
        substituted those matched substrings into the pattern
        <code>#xpath1(//div[@n='$1']/div[$2])</code> to produce a
        fragment identifier, which when appended to the
        <att>xml:base</att> in force produces the absolute URI
        reference 
        <code>http://www.jph.org/resources/books/Bible.xml#xpath1(//div[@n='Matt']/div[5])</code>.</p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">If the input string had been <q>Matt</q>, neither the first
          nor the second regular expressions would have successfully
          matched. The application would have then tried the third,
          <code>(.+)</code>, producing the matched substring <q>Matt</q>,
          and the URI Reference
          <code>http://www.jph.org/resources/books/Bible.xml#xpath1(//div[@n='Matt'])</code>.</p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It is an error to reference more matched substrings than
          are produced by the regular expression. For example:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><cRefPattern matchPattern="(.+) (.+):(.+)" replacementPattern="//div[@n='$1']/div[$2]/div[$3]/p[$4]"/></egXML>
          would produce an error, since only three matched
          substrings would have been produced, but a fourth (<code>$4</code>) was
          referenced.</p>
          <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It is quite reasonable to believe that encoders would
          actually prefer much more precise regular expressions than
          those used as examples above. E.g.,
          <code>^\s*([1-9]?[A-Z][a-z]+)\s+([1-9][0-9]?[0-9]?):([1-9][0-9]?)\s*$</code>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In the above example, the value of <att>cRef</att> was used
        to generate a Fragment Identifier, which in turn was used to

          encoders. However, this specification might be useful to the
          development of a process for recognizing canonical
          references in non-TEI documents (such as plain text
          documents), possibly as part of their conversion to TEI.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In this section, we define three general purposes elements
    which may be used to mark and categorize both a span of text and a
    point within one. These elements have several uses, most notably
    to provide elements which can be given identifiers for use when
    aligning or linking to parts of a document, as discussed elsewhere
    in this chapter. They also provide a convenient way of extending
    the semantics of the TEI markup scheme in a theory-neutral manner,
    by providing for two neutral or <soCalled>anonymous</soCalled>
    elements to which the encoder can add any meaning not supplied by
    other TEI defined elements.
    <specList>
      <specDesc key="anchor"/>
      <specDesc key="ab" atts="part"/>
      <specDesc key="seg"/>
    </specList>
    The elements <gi>anchor</gi> and <gi>ab</gi> are both members of
    the class <ident type="class">att.typed</ident>, from which they
    inherit the following attributes:
    <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.typed" atts="type subtype"/>
    </specList>
    The <gi>seg</gi> element is a member of the class <ident type="class">att.segLike</ident>, from which it inherits the following
    attributes:
    <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.segLike" atts="type function part"/>
    </specList></p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>anchor</gi> element may be thought of as an empty
    <gi>seg</gi>, or as an artifice enabling an identifier to be
    attached to any position in a text. Like the <gi>mileStone</gi>
    element discussed in section <ptr target="#CORS"/>, it is useful
    where multiple views of a document are to be combined, for
    example, when a logical view based on paragraphs or verse lines is
    to be mapped on to a physical view based on manuscript lines.
    However, it differs from the milestone and related elements in
    that the <gi>anchor</gi> element should not be used to mark the
    start or end of an arbitrary zone within a text, but only to mark
    an arbitrary point used for alignment, or as the target of a
    spanning element such as those discussed in section <ptr target="#PHAD"/>.</p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For example, suppose that we wish to mark the end of the fifth
    word following each occurrence of some term in a particular text,
    perhaps to assist with some collocational analysis. This can most
    easily be done with the help of the <tag>anchor</tag> tag, as
    follows:

    In section <ptr target="#SACS1"/> we discuss ways in which these
    <gi>anchor</gi> points might be used to represent an alignment
    such as one might get in a keyword-in-context concordance.</p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>seg</gi> element may be used at the encoder's
    discretion to mark almost any segment of the text of interest for
    processing. One use of the element is to mark text features for
    which no appropriate markup is otherwise defined, i.e. as a simple
    extension mechanism. Another use is to provide an identifier for
    some segment which is to be pointed at by some other element, i.e.
    to provide a target, or a part of a target, for a <gi>ptr</gi> or
    other similar element.</p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Several examples of uses for the <gi>seg</gi> element are
    provided elsewhere in these Guidelines. For example:
    <list type="simple">
      <item>as a means of marking segments significant in a metrical
      or rhyming analysis (see section <ptr target="#VEME"/>)</item>
      <item>as a means of marking typographic lines in drama (see
      section <ptr target="#DRBOD"/>) or title pages (see section <ptr target="#DSTITL"/>)</item>
      <item>as a means of marking prosody- or pause-defined units in
      transcribed speech (see section <ptr target="#TSSASE"/>)</item>
      <item>as a means of marking linguistic or other analyses in a
      theory-neutral manner (see chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>
      passim)</item></list></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In the following simple example, the <gi>seg</gi> element
      simply delimits the extent of a stutter, a textual feature for
      which no element is provided in these Guidelines.
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>Don't say <q><seg type="stutter">I-I-I</seg>'m afraid,</q>
Melvin, just say <q>I'm afraid.</q></q></egXML>
      <!-- David Shields, Dead Languages, 1990, p10 -->
      The <gi>seg</gi> element is particularly useful for the mark-up
      of linguistically significant constituents such as the phrases
      that may be the output of an automatic parsing system. This
      example also demonstrates the use of the <att>xml:id</att>
      attribute to carry an identifier which other parts of a document
      may use to point to, or align with:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[  ]]><seg xml:id="bl0034" type="sentence">  
          <seg xml:id="bl0034.1" type="phrase">Literate and illiterate speech</seg>

          <seg xml:id="bl0034.3" type="phrase">are plainly different.</seg>
      </seg></egXML>
      <!-- Bloomfield, "Literate and Illiterate Speech", 1927   --></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As the above example shows, <gi>seg</gi> elements may be
      nested directly within one another, to any degree of analysis
      considered appropriate. This is taken a little further in the
      following example, where the <att>type</att> and
      <att>subtype</att> attributes have been used to further
      categorise each word of the sentence (the <att>xml:id</att>
      attributes have been removed to reduce the complexity of the
      example):

        </seg></egXML></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(The example values shown are chosen for simplicity of
      comprehension, rather than verisimilitude). It should also be
      noted that specialized segment elements are defined in section
      <ptr target="#AILC"/> to facilitate this particular kind of
      analysis. These allow for the explicit mark up of units called
      <term>s-units</term>, <term>clauses</term>,
      <term>phrases</term>, <term>words</term>, <term>morphemes</term>
      and <term>characters</term>, which may be felt preferable to the
      more generic approach typified by use of the <gi>seg</gi>
      element. Using these, the first phrase above might be encoded
      simply as
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[  ]]><phr type="noun">    
          <w type="adjective">Literate</w>
          <w type="conjunction">and</w>
          <w type="adjective">illiterate</w>
          <w type="noun">speech</w>
      </phr></egXML>
      Note the way in which the <att>type</att> attribute of these
      specialized elements now carries the value carried by the
      <att>subtype</att> attribute of the more general <gi>seg</gi>
      element. For an analysis not using these traditional linguistic
      categories however, the <gi>seg</gi> element provides a simple
      but powerful mechanism.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In language corpora and similar material, the <gi>seg</gi>
      element may be used to provide an end-to-end segmentation as an
      alternative to the more specific <gi>s</gi> element proposed in
      chapter <ptr target="#AILC"/> for the mark-up of orthographic
      sentences, or <term>s-units</term>. However, it may be more
      useful to use the <gi>s</gi> element for this purpose, since
      this means that the <gi>seg</gi> element can then be used to
      mark both features within s-units and segments composed of
      s-units, as in the following example:<note place="foot">See
      section <ptr target="#AISP"/>, where the text from which this
      fragment is taken is analyzed.</note>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg xml:id="s1s3" type="narrative unit">
  <s xml:id="s1">Sigmund, the <seg type="patronymic">son of Volsung</seg>,

  <s xml:id="s2">Sinfiotli was the eldest of his sons.</s>
  <s xml:id="s3"> ... </s>
</seg></egXML></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Like other elements, the <gi>seg</gi> tag must be properly
      enclosed within other elements. Thus, a single <gi>seg</gi>
      element can be used to group together words in different
      sentences only if the sentences are not themselves tagged. The
      first of the following two encodings is legal, but the second is
      not.
<!-- Made up example -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[Give me ]]><seg type="phrase">a dozen. Or two or three.</seg></egXML>
<eg><![CDATA[<!-- Illegal! -->
<s>Give me <seg type="phrase">a dozen.</s>
<s>Or two or three.</s></seg>]]></eg></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <att>part</att> attribute may be used as one simple
      method of overcoming this restriction:
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><s>Give me <seg type="phrase" part="I">a dozen.</seg></s><![CDATA[
]]><s><seg part="F">Or two or three.</seg></s></egXML>
      Another solution is to use the <gi>join</gi> element discussed
      in section <ptr target="#SAAG"/>; this requires that each of the
      <gi>seg</gi> elements be given an identifier. For further
      discussion of this generic encoding problem see also chapter
      <ptr target="#NH"/>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>seg</gi> element has the same content as a paragraph
      in prose: it can therefore be used to group together consecutive
      sequences of <ident type="class">model.inter</ident> class elements,
      such as lists, quotations, notes, stage directions etc. as well
      as to contain sequences of phrase-level elements. It cannot
      however be used to group together sequences of paragraphs or
      similar text units such as verse lines; for this purpose, the
      encoder should use intermediate pointers, as described in
      section <ptr target="#SAPTIP"/> or the methods described in
      section <ptr target="#SAAG"/>. It is particularly important that
      the encoder provide a clear description of the principles by
      which a text has been segmented, and the way in which that
      segmentation is represented. This should include a description
      of the method used and the significance of any categorization
      codes. The description should be provided as a series of
      paragraphs within the <gi>segmentation</gi> element of the
      encoding description in the TEI header, as described in section
      <ptr target="#HD53"/>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>seg</gi> element may also be used to encode
      simultaneous or mutually exclusive variants of a text when the
      more special purpose elements for simple editorial changes,
      abbreviation and expansion, addition and deletion, or for a
      critical apparatus are not appropriate. In these circumstances,
      one <gi>seg</gi> is encoded for each possible variant, and the
      set of them is enclosed in a <gi>choice</gi> element. </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For example, if one were writing dual-platform instructions for
      installation of software, it might be useful to use <gi>seg</gi>
      to record platform-specific pieces of mutually exclusive text.
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[…

      <seg type="platform" subtype="PC">alt</seg></choice><![CDATA[-f will …]]></egXML></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The remainder of this chapter contains a number of examples
      of the use of the <gi>seg</gi> element simply to provide an
      element to which an identifier may be attached, for example so
      that another segment may be linked or related to it in some
      way.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>ab</gi> (anonymous block) 
      element performs a similar function to that of the <gi>seg</gi> element, 
      but is used for portions of the

      <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In this section we introduce the notions of
      <term>correspondence</term>, expressed by the <att>corresp</att>
      attribute, and of <term>alignment</term>, which is a special
      kind of correspondence involving an ordered set of
      correspondences. Both cases may be represented using the
      <gi>link</gi> and <gi>linkGrp</gi> elements introduced in
      section <ptr target="#SAPT"/>. We also discuss the special case
      of alignment in time or <term>synchronization</term>, for which
      special purpose elements are proposed in section <ptr target="#SASY"/>.</p>
      <div type="div3" xml:id="SACS1">
        <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Correspondence</head>
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A common requirement in text analysis is to represent
        correspondences between two or more parts of a single
        document, or between places in different documents. Provided
        that explicit elements are available to represent the parts or
        places to be linked, then the global linking attribute
        <att>corresp</att> may be used to encode such correspondence,
        once it has been identified.
        <specList>
          <specDesc key="att.global.linking"/>
        </specList>
        This is one of the attributes made available by the mechanism
        described in the introduction to this chapter (<ptr target="#SA"/>). Correspondence can also be expressed by means
        of the <gi>link</gi> element introduced in section <ptr target="#SAPT"/>.</p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Where the correspondence is between <emph>spans</emph>, the
        <gi>seg</gi> element should be used, if no other element is
        available. Where the correspondence is between
        <emph>points</emph>, the <gi>anchor</gi> element should be
        used, if no other element is available.</p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The use of the <att>corresp</att> attribute with spans of
        content is illustrated by the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><title xml:id="SHIRLEY">Shirley</title><![CDATA[, which made

        <!-- commas after 'Shirley' and 'ago' added conjecturally by  -->
        <!-- msm after consultation with lb.                          -->
        Here the anaphoric phrases <mentioned>the network</mentioned>
        and <mentioned>the show</mentioned> have been associated
        directly with the elements to which they refer by means of
        <att>corresp</att> attributes. This mechanism is simple to
        apply, but has the drawback that it is not possible to specify
        more exactly what kind of correspondence is intended. Where
        this attribute is used, therefore, encoders are encouraged to
        specify their intent in the associated encoding declarations
        in the TEI Header.</p>
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Essentially, what the <att>corresp</att> attribute does is
        to specify that the element that has the attribute and the
        element(s) the attribute points to are doubly linked.<note place="foot">The <att>corresp</att> attribute is thus distinct
        from the <att>target</att> attribute in that it is understood
        to create a double, rather than a single, link. It is also
        distinct from the <att>targets</att> attribute in that the
        latter lists all the identifiers of the elements that are
        doubly linked, whereas the <att>corresp</att> doubly links the
        element that bears the attribute with the element(s) that make
        up the value of the attribute.</note> Therefore, we can also
        use the <gi>link</gi> and <gi>linkGrp</gi> elements defined in
        section <ptr target="#SAPT"/> to indicate correspondence among
        elements. Moreover, the use of these elements provides a
        convenient place to indicate what kind of correspondence is
        intended as in the following retagging of the preceding
        example.

          <head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Alignment of Parallel Texts</head>
          <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">One very important application area for the alignment of
          parallel texts is multilingual corpora. Consider, for
          example, the need to align <soCalled>translation
          pairs</soCalled> of sentences drawn from a corpus such as
          the Canadian Hansard, in which each sentence is given in
          both English and French. Concerning this problem, Gale and
          Church write: <q rend="display">Most English sentences match
          exactly one French sentence, but it is possible for an
          English sentence to match two or more French sentences. The
          first two English sentences [in the example below]
          illustrate a particularly hard case where two English
          sentences align to two French sentences. No smaller
          alignments are possible because the clause
          <q>...sales...were higher...</q> in the first English
          sentence corresponds to (part of) the second French
          sentence. The next two alignments ... illustrate the more
          typical case where one English sentence aligns with exactly
          one French sentence. The final alignment matches two English
          sentences to a single French sentence. These alignments
          [which were produced by a computer program] agreed with the
          results produced by a human judge.<note place="foot">See
          <bibl><author>William A. Gale and Kenneth W. Church</author>
          <title level="a">Program for aligning sentences in bilingual
          corpora</title>, <title>Computational Linguistics</title> 19
          (1993): 75–102</bibl>, from which the example in the
          text is taken.</note></q></p>
          <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The alignment produced by Gale and Church's program can
          be expressed in four different ways. The encoder must first
          decide whether to represent the alignment in terms of points
          within each text (using the <gi>anchor</gi> element) or in
          terms of whole stretches of text, using the <gi>seg</gi>
          element. To some extent the choice will depend on the
          process by which the software works out where alignment
          occurs, and the intention of the encoder. Secondly, the
          encoder may elect to represent the actual encoding using
          either <att>corresp</att> attributes attached to the
          individual <gi>anchor</gi> or <gi>seg</gi> elements, or
          using a free standing <gi>linkGrp</gi> element.</p>
          <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We present first a solution using <gi>anchor</gi>
          elements bearing only <att>corresp</att> attributes:

        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There is no requirement that the <att>corresp</att>
        attribute be specified in both English and French texts, since
        (as noted above) this attribute is defined as representing a
        mutual association. However, it may simplify processing to do
        so, and also avoids giving the impression that the English is
        translating the French, or vice versa. More seriously, this
        encoding does not make explicit the fact that it is in fact
        the entire stretch of text between the anchors which is being
        aligned, not simply the points themselves. If for example one
        text contained material omitted from the other, this approach
        would not be appropriate.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The preceding encoding of the alignment of parallel passages from

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To demonstrate this facility, we consider how we might encode the

carefully-aligned translation of the Latin into English, German or some
other vernacular. Key terms in the two texts are typographically
distinct, and are linked to the picture by numbers, which appear in the
two texts and within the picture as well.<note place="foot">Our example uses the
English translation of Charles Hoole (1659), and is taken from

This example of SVG defines three rectangles 
at the locations with the specified x and y co-ordinates. A view is
defined on these, enabling them to be 
mapped by an SVG processor to the image found at the URL specified
(<ident>p1764.png</ident>). It also defines unique identifiers for
the whole image, and the three views of it, which we will use within our
alignment, as shown next (for further discussion of the handling of
 images and graphics, see section <ptr target="#FTGRA"/>; for further
 discussion of using non-TEI XML vocabularies such as SVG within a TEI
 document, see section <ptr target="#ST-aliens"/>).

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As printed, the Comenius text exhibits three kinds of alignment.
 <list type="ordered">
   <item n="1">The English and Latin portions are printed in two
   parallel columns, with corresponding phrases, (represented above by
   <gi>seg</gi> elements), more or less next to each other.</item>
   <item n="2">Particular words or phrases are marked as terms in the
   two languages by a change of rendition: the English text, which
   otherwise uses black letter type throughout, has the words
   <mentioned>The Study</mentioned>, <mentioned>a Student</mentioned>,
   <mentioned>Studies</mentioned>, and <mentioned>Books</mentioned> in
   a roman font; in the Latin text, which is printed in roman, the
   corresponding words (<mentioned>Museum</mentioned>,
   <mentioned>Studiosus</mentioned>, <mentioned>Studiis</mentioned>,
   and <mentioned>Libros</mentioned>) are all in italic.</item>
   <item n="3">Numbered labels appear within the text portions,
   linking keywords to each other and to sections of the picture.
   These labels, which have been left out of the above encoding, are
   attached to the first, third, and last segments in each language
   quoted below, and also appear (rather indistinctly) within the
   picture itself. Thus, the images of the study, the student, and his
   books are each aligned with the correct term for them in the two
   languages. 
   </item></list></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The first kind of alignment might be represented by using the
<att>corresp</att> attribute on the <gi>seg</gi> element. The second
kind might be represented by using the <gi>gloss</gi> and <gi>term</gi>
mechanism described in section <ptr target="#COHQU"/>. The third kind of
alignment might be represented using pointers embedded within the
texts, for example: 
<eg><![CDATA[...
      <seg xml:id="e9803">where a <ref n="2" target="#P982">Student</ref>,</seg>
...
      <seg xml:id="l9803">ubi <ref n="2" target="#P982">Studiosus</ref>,</seg>
...]]></eg>

We choose however to use
the <gi>link</gi> element, since this provides a more efficient way of
representing the three-way alignment between English, Latin and picture
without redundancy.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><linkGrp type="alignment">
   <link targets="#e9801 #l9801 #p981"/>
   <link targets="#e9802 #l9802"/>
   <link targets="#e9803 #l9803 #p982"/>
   <link targets="#e9804 #l9804"/>
   <link targets="#e9805 #l9805"/>
   <link targets="#e9806 #l9806"/>
   <link targets="#e9807 #l9807"/>
   <link targets="#e9808 #l9808 #p983"/>
</linkGrp></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This map, of course, only aligns whole segments and image portions,
since these are the only parts of our encoding which bear identifiers
and can therefore be pointed to. To add to it the alignment between
the typographically distinct words mentioned above, new elements must
be defined, either within the text itself or externally by using stand
off techniques. Encoding these word pairs as <gi>term</gi>
and <gi>gloss</gi>, although intuitively obvious, requires a
non-trivial decision as to whether the Latin text is glossing the
English, or vice-versa. Tagging all the marked words as <gi>term</gi>
avoids the difficult decision, but might be thought by some encoders
to convey the wrong information about the words in question. Simply
tagging them as additional embedded <gi>seg</gi> elements with
identifiers that can be aligned like the others is also a possibility.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">These solutions all require the addition of further markup to the text. This
may pose no problems, or it may be infeasible, for example because the text is
held on a read-only medium. If it is not feasible to add more markup
to the original text, some form of stand-off markup will be
needed. Any item within the text that can be pointed to using the
various pointer schemes discussed in this chapter may be used, not
simply those which rely on the existence of an <att>xml:id</att>
attribute. For example, if the segments in our example did not have
identifiers, they could still be addressed using the notation
introduced in <ptr target="#SAES"/> above. Suppose our example had been
more lightly tagged, as follows:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div xml:id="E98" xml:lang="en" type="lesson">
   <head>The Study</head>
      <ab>The Study</ab>
      <ab>is a place</ab>
      <ab>where a Student,</ab>
  </div><![CDATA[
]]><div xml:id="L98" xml:lang="la" type="lesson">
   <head>Muséum</head>
      <ab>Museum</ab>
      <ab>est locus</ab>
      <ab>ubi Studiosus,</ab>
</div></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To express the same alignment mentioned above, we could use an
Xpath expression to identify the required <gi>seg</gi> elements:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><linkGrp type="alignment">
   <link targets="#element(L98/2) #element(E98/2) #p981"/>
   <link targets="#element(L98/3) #element(E98/3)"/>
</linkGrp></egXML>
In the absence of any markup around individual substrings of
the element content, the string-range pointer scheme discussed in <ptr target="#SATSSR"/> may also be helpful: for example, to indicate that the words
<mentioned>Studies</mentioned> and <mentioned>Studiis</mentioned>
correspond, we might express the link between them as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[
]]><link targets="#string-range(xpath1(id('e9806')),16,6)                #string-range(xpath1(id('l9806')),0,7)"/></egXML></p>

<div type="div2" xml:id="SASY">
<head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Synchronization</head>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In the previous section we discussed two particular kinds of
alignment: alignment of parallel texts in different languages; and
alignment of texts and portions of an image. In this section we address
another specialized form of alignment: synchronization. The need to
mark the relative positions of text components with respect to time
arises most naturally and frequently in transcribed spoken texts, but it
may arise in any text in which quoted speech occurs, or events are
described within a time frame. The methods described here are also
generalizable for other kinds of alignment (for example, alignment of
text elements with respect to space).</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="SASYNC">
<head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Aligning Synchronous Events</head>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To mark synchronous elements, the <att>synch</att> attribute, which
is one of the linking attributes that are available for all text
elements, may be used. 
Alternatively, the <gi>link</gi> and <gi>linkGrp</gi> elements may be
used to make explicit the fact that the synchronous elements are
aligned.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To illustrate the use of these mechanisms for marking synchrony,
consider the following representation of a spoken text:
<!-- From BNC, via LB, retranscribed without SGML markup -->
<eg><![CDATA[B: The first time in twenty five years, we've cooked Christmas
   (unclear) for a blooming great load of people.
A: So you're [1] (unclear) [2]
B: [1] It will be [2] nice in a way, but, [3] be strange. [4]
A: [3] Yeah [4], yeah, cos it, it's [5] the [6]
B: [5] not [6]]]></eg></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This representation uses numbers in brackets to mark the points at
which speakers overlap each other. For example, the <mentioned>[1]</mentioned>
in A's first speech is to be understood as coinciding with the
<mentioned>[1]</mentioned> in B's second speech.<note place="foot">This sample is taken from
a conversation collected and transcribed for the British National
Corpus.</note></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To encode this we use the  spoken texts module, described
in chapter <ptr target="#TS"/>, together with the module
described in the present chapter. First, we transcribe this text,
marking the synchronous points with <gi>anchor</gi> elements, and
providing a <att>synch</att> attribute on one of each of the pairs of
synchronous anchors. As noted in the example given above (section <ptr target="#SACSAL"/>), correspondence, and hence synchrony, is a
symmetric relation; therefore the attribute need only be specified on
one of the pairs of synchronous anchors.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><![CDATA[    ]]><div xml:id="BNC-d1" type="convers">

<!-- ... --></div></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We can encode this same example using <gi>link</gi> and
<gi>linkGrp</gi> elements to make the temporal alignment explicit. A <gi>back</gi>
element has been used to enclose the <gi>linkGrp</gi> element, but the links
may be located anywhere the encoder finds convenient:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back>
    <linkGrp xml:id="lg1" domains="BNC-d1 BNC-d1" targFunc="speaker.a speaker.b" type="synchronous_alignment">
      <link xml:id="l1" targets="#t1a #t1b"/>
      <link xml:id="l2" targets="#t2a #t2b"/>
      <link xml:id="l3" targets="#t3a #t3b"/>
      <link xml:id="l4" targets="#t4a #t4b"/>
      <link xml:id="l5" targets="#t5a #t5b"/>
      <link xml:id="l6" targets="#t6a #t6b"/>
    </linkGrp>
  </back></egXML>
The
<att>xml:id</att> attributes are provided for the <gi>link</gi> and
<gi>linkGrp</gi> elements here for reasons discussed  in the next
section, <ptr target="#SASYMP"/>. 
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As with other forms of alignment, synchronization may be expressed
between stretches of speech as well as between points. When complete
utterances are synchronous, for example, if one person says
<mentioned>What?</mentioned> and another <mentioned>No!</mentioned> at the same time,
that can be represented without <gi>anchor</gi> elements as follows.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u synch="#u02" xml:id="u01" who="#a">What?</u><![CDATA[
]]><u xml:id="u02" who="#b">No!</u></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A simple way of expressing <term>overlap</term> (where one speaker
starts speaking before another has finished) is thus to use the
<gi>seg</gi> element to encode the overlapping portions of speech. For
example,
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u who="#a"> So you're <unclear synch="#u-b1"/> </u><![CDATA[
]]><u who="#b"><seg xml:id="u-b1"> It will be </seg> nice in a way, but,
           <seg synch="#u-a3"> be strange. </seg> </u><![CDATA[
]]><u who="#a"><seg xml:id="u-a3"> Yeah </seg>, yeah, cos it,
           its <seg synch="#u-b2"> the </seg> </u><![CDATA[
]]><u xml:id="u-b2" who="#b"> not </u></egXML>
Note in this encoding how synchronization has been effected between an
empty <gi>unclear</gi> element and a <gi>seg</gi>, and between an entire
<gi>u</gi> element and another <gi>seg</gi>, using the <att>synch</att>
attribute. Alternatively, a <gi>linkGrp</gi> could be used in the same
way as above.</p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="SASYMP">
<head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Placing Synchronous Events in Time</head>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A synchronous alignment specifies which points in a spoken text occur
at the same time, and the order in which they occur, but does not say at
what time those points actually occur. If that information is available
to the encoder it can be represented by means of the <gi>when</gi> and
<gi>timeline</gi> elements, whose description and attributes are the
following:
<specList><specDesc key="when" atts="absolute interval unit since"/><specDesc key="timeline" atts="origin interval unit"/></specList></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Each <gi>when</gi> element indicates a point in time, either directly
by means of the <att>absolute</att> attribute, whose value is a string
which specifies a particular time, or indirectly by means of the
<att>since</att> attribute, which points to another <gi>when</gi>. If
the <att>since</att> is used, then the <att>interval</att> and
<att>unit</att> attributes should also be used to indicate the amount of
time that has elapsed since the time specified by the element pointed to
by the <att>since</att> attribute; the value <val>-1</val>
can be given to indicate that the interval is unknown.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">If the <gi>when</gi> elements are uniformly spaced in time, then the
<att>interval</att> and <att>unit</att> values need be given once in the
<gi>timeline</gi>, and not repeated in any of the <gi>when</gi>
elements. If the intervals vary, but the units are all the same, then
the <att>unit</att> attribute alone can be given in the
<gi>timeline</gi> element, and the <att>interval</att> attribute given
in the <gi>when</gi> element.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <att>origin</att> attribute in the <gi>timeline</gi> element
points to a <gi>when</gi> element which specifies the reference or
origin for the timings within the <gi>timeline</gi>; this must, of
course, specify its position in time absolutely.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The following <gi>timeline</gi> might be used to accompany the marked
up conversation shown in the preceding section:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><timeline xml:id="tl1" origin="#w0" unit="ms">
   <when xml:id="w0" absolute="11:30:00"/>
   <when xml:id="w1" interval="unknown" since="#w0"/>
   <when xml:id="w2" interval="100" since="#w1"/>
   <when xml:id="w3" interval="200" since="#w2"/>
   <when xml:id="w4" interval="150" since="#w3"/>
   <when xml:id="w5" interval="250" since="#w4"/>
   <when xml:id="w6" interval="100" since="#w5"/>
</timeline></egXML>
The information in this <gi>timeline</gi> could now be linked to the
information in the <gi>linkGrp</gi> which provides the temporal
alignment (synchronization) for the text, as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><linkGrp type="temporal_specification" domains="lg1 tl1" targFunc="synch.points when">
   <link targets="#l1 #w1"/>
   <link targets="#l2 #w2"/>
   <link targets="#l3 #w3"/>
   <link targets="#l4 #w4"/>
   <link targets="#l5 #w5"/>
   <link targets="#l6 #w6"/>
</linkGrp></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To avoid the need for two distinct link groups (one marking the
synchronization of anchors with each other, and the other marking their
alignment with points on the time line) it would be better to link the
<gi>when</gi> elements with the synchronous points directly:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><linkGrp type="temporal_specification" domains="BNC-d1 BNC-d1 tl1" targFunc="speaker.a speaker.b when">
   <link targets="#t1a #t1b #w1"/>
   <link targets="#t2a #t2b #w2"/>
   <link targets="#t3a #t3b #w3"/>
   <link targets="#t4a #t4b #w4"/>
   <link targets="#t5a #t5b #w5"/>
   <link targets="#t6a #t6b #w6"/>
</linkGrp></egXML></p>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Finally, suppose that a digitized audio recording is also
available, and an XML file that asigns identifiers to the various

Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL, pronounced

URIs pointing to the <gi scheme="SMIL">audi</gi> elements could also
be included as a fourth component in each of the above <gi>link</gi>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For further discussion of this and related aspects of encoding
transcribed speech, refer to chapter <ptr target="#TS"/>.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>when</gi> and <gi>timeline</gi> elements are defined as
follows:
<specGrp xml:id="DSASYMP" n="Temporal specification">

<div type="div2" xml:id="SAIE">
<head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Identical Elements and Virtual Copies</head>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This section introduces the notion of a <term>virtual element</term>,
that is, an element which is not explicitly present in a text, but the
presence of which an application can infer from the encoding supplied.
In this section, we are concerned with virtual elements made by simply
cloning existing elements. In the next section (<ptr target="#SAAG"/>), we
discuss virtual elements made by aggregating existing elements.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It is useful to be able to represent the fact that one element of
text is identical to others, for analytical purposes, or (especially if
the elements have lengthy content) to obviate the need to repeat the
content. For example, consider the repetition of the <tag>date</tag>
element in the following material:
        <!-- Orwell, Nineteen-Eighty-Four  -->
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>In small clumsy letters he wrote:
<q rend="centered italic"><date xml:id="d840404">April 4th,
1984</date>.</q></p><![CDATA[
]]><p>He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had
descended upon him. ...</p><![CDATA[
]]><p>His small but childish handwriting straggled up
and down the page, shedding first its capital letters
and finally even its full stops:
<q rend="italic"><date>April 4th, 1984</date>.
Last night to the flicks. ... </q></p></egXML>
Suppose now that we wish to encode the fact that the second
<gi>date</gi> element above has identical content to the first. The
<att>sameAs</att> attribute is provided for this purpose. Using it, we
can recode the last line of the above example as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date sameAs="#d840404" rend="italic">April 4th, 1984</date><![CDATA[
Last night to the flicks ... ]]></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <att>sameAs</att> attribute may be used to document the fact
that two elements have identical content. It may be regarded as a
special kind of link. It should only be attached to an element with
identical content to that it indicates, or to one the content of which
clearly designates it as a repetition, such as the word
<mentioned>repeat</mentioned> or <mentioned>bis</mentioned> in the
representation of the chorus of a song, the second time it is to be
sung. The relation specified by the <att>sameAs</att> attribute is
symmetric: if a chorus is repeated three times and each repetition
bears a <att>sameAs</att> attribute indicating the first occurrence of
the element concerned, it is implied that each chorus is identical,
and there is no need for the first occurrence to specify any of its
copies.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <att>copyOf</att> attribute is used in a similar way to
indicate that the content of the element bearing it is identical to
that of another. The difference is that the content is not itself
repeated. The effect of this attribute is thus to create a
<term>virtual copy</term> of the element indicated. Using this
attribute, the repeated date in the first example above could be
recoded as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date rend="italic" copyOf="#d840404"/></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">An application program should replace whatever is the actual content
of an element bearing a <att>copyOf</att> attribute with the content of
the element specified by it. If the content of the element specified
includes other elements, these will become embedded within the element
bearing the attribute. Care must be taken to ensure that the document
is valid both before and after this embedding takes
place. If, for example, the element bearing a <att>copyOf</att>
attribute requires a mandatory sub-component, then this component must
be present (though possibly empty), even though it will be replaced by
the content of the targetted element.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The following example demonstrates how the <att>copyOf</att>
attribute may be used in conjunction with the <gi>seg</gi> element to
highlight the differences between almost identical repetitions:

<head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Aggregation</head>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Because of the strict hierarchical organization of elements, or for
other reasons, it may not always be possible or desirable to include
all the parts of a possibly fragmented text segment within a single
element. In section <ptr target="#SAPTIP"/> we introduced the notion of
an intermediate pointer as a way of pointing to discontinuous segments
of this kind. In this section we first describe another way of linking
the parts of a discontinuous whole, using a set of linking attributes,
which are made available for any tag by following the procedure
described at the beginning of this chapter. We then describe how the
<gi>link</gi> element may be used to aggregate such segments, and
finally introduce the <gi>join</gi> element, which is a
special-purpose linking element specifically for representing the
aggregation of parts, and the <gi>joinGrp</gi> for grouping
<tag>join</tag> tags.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The linking attributes for aggregation are <att>next</att> and
<att>prev</att>; each of these attributes has a single identifier as its
value:
<specList><specDesc key="att.global.linking"/></specList></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>join</gi> element is also a member of the class of <ident type="class">att.pointing</ident> elements, and so may carry any of the
attributes of that class; for the list, see section <ptr target="#SAPT"/>.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Here is the material on which we base our first illustration of the
use of these mechanisms. Our problem is to represent the S-units
identified below as <val>qs3</val> and <val>qs4</val> as a single (but discontinuous) whole:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q who="waitress">
   <s xml:id="qs2">Monsieur Paul, after he has taken equal
      parts of goose breast and the finest pork, and
      broken a certain number of egg yolks into them,
      and ground them <emph>very</emph>, very fine,
      cooks all with seasoning for some three hours.</s>
   <s xml:id="qs3">
      <emph>But</emph>,</s> </q><![CDATA[
]]><s xml:id="ps2">she pushed her face nearer, and looked with
   ferocious gloating at the pâté
   inside me, her eyes like X rays,</s><![CDATA[
]]><q who="waitress">
   <s xml:id="qs4">he never stops stirring it!</s>
   <s xml:id="qs5">Figure to yourself the work of it —</s>
   <s xml:id="qs6">stir, stir, never stopping!</s>
</q></egXML>
<!-- M.F.K. Fisher, I was really very hungry, As They Were, p43  -->
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Using the <att>prev</att> and <att>next</att> attributes, we can
link the s-units with identifiers <val>qs3</val> and <val>qs4</val>, either singly or doubly as follows:
<eg><![CDATA[  <s xml:id="qs3" next="#qs4"><emph>But</emph>,</s>
  <s xml:id="qs4">he never stops stirring it!</s>]]></eg>
<eg><![CDATA[  <s xml:id="qs3"><emph>But</emph>,</s>
  <s xml:id="qs4" prev="#qs3">he never stops stirring it!</s>]]></eg>
<eg><![CDATA[  <s xml:id="qs3" next="#qs4"><emph>But</emph>,</s>
  <s xml:id="qs4" prev="#qs3">he never stops stirring it!</s>]]></eg>
Double linking of the two S-units, as illustrated by the last of these
encodings, is equivalent to specifying a <tag>link</tag> tag:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><link type="join" targets="#qs3 #qs4"/></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Such a <tag>link</tag> element must carry a <att>type</att>
attribute with a value of <val>join</val> to specify that the link is
to be understood as joining its targets into a single aggregate.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>join</gi> element is equivalent to a <gi>link</gi> element of
type <val>join</val>.
<!-- LB added following, possibly contentious, clarification -->
Unlike the <gi>link</gi> element, the <gi>join</gi> element can
additionally specify information about the virtual element which it
represents, by means of its <att>result</att> attribute. And finally,
unlike the <gi>link</gi> element, the position of a <gi>join</gi>
element within a text is significant: it must be supplied at a position
where the element indicated by its <att>result</att> attribute would be
contextually legal.
<!-- and removed following -->
        <!--   We now define the following equivalence:<eg>           -->
        <!-- <![CDATA[-->
        <!-- <link type='join'> = <join>                                -->

        <!-- </eg>                                                    -->
        <!--                                                          -->
        <!-- 
<p>By using the <gi>join</gi> tag for representing       -->
        <!-- element aggregation, another attribute is made           -->
        <!-- available to indicate the nature of the                  -->
        <!-- <term>result</term> of the joining operation.            -->
        <!-- Moreover, we specify the default value for the           -->
        <!-- <att>targOrder</att> attribute to be <term>Y</term>.     -->
<specList><specDesc key="join" atts="result targets"/><specDesc key="joinGrp" atts="result"/></specList>
To conclude the above example, we now use a <gi>join</gi> element to
represent the virtual sentence formed by the aggregation of <val>s1</val> and <val>s2</val>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><join targets="#qs3 #qs4" result="s"/></egXML>
As a further example, consider the following list of authors' names.
The object of the <gi>join</gi> element here is to provide another
list, composed of those authors from the larger list who happen to
come from Heidelberg:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The following example shows how <gi>join</gi> can be used to
reconstruct a text cited in fragments presented out of order. The poem

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As with other forms of link, a grouping element <tag>joinGrp</tag>
is available for use when a number of <tag>join</tag> elements of the
same kind co-occur. This avoids the need to specify the
<att>result</att> attribute for each <gi>join</gi> if they are all of
the same type, and also allows us to restrict the domain within which
their target elements are to be found, in the same way as for
<gi>linkGrp</gi> elements (see <ptr target="#SAPTLG"/>). Like a
<gi>join</gi>, a <gi>joinGrp</gi> may appear only where the elements
represented by its contents are legal. Thus if we had created many
<tag>join</tag> tags of the sort just described, we could group them
together, and require that their components are all contained by an
element with the identifier <val>MFKFhungry</val> as
follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><joinGrp domains="mfkfhungry mfkfhungry" result="s">
   <join targets="#qs3 #qs4"/>
   <join targets="#qs5 #qs6"/>
</joinGrp><![CDATA[
]]></egXML>
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>join</gi> element is useful as a means of representing
non-hierarchic structures (as further discussed in chapter <ptr target="#NH"/>). It may also be used as a convenient way of representing a
variety of analytic units, like the <gi>span</gi> and <gi>interp</gi>
elements discussed in chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>. As an example, consider
the following passage:
<q rend="display">
<p>Zui-Gan called out to himself every day, <q>Master.</q></p>
<p>Then he answered himself, <q>Yes, sir.</q></p>
<p>And then he added, <q>Become sober.</q></p>
<p>Again he answered, <q>Yes, sir.</q></p>
<p><q>And after that,</q> he continued, <q>do not be deceived by
others.</q></p>
<p><q>Yes, sir; yes, sir,</q> he replied.</p></q></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Suppose now that we wish to represent an interpretation of the above
passage in which we distinguish between the various
<soCalled>voices</soCalled> adopted by the character Zui-Gan. In the
following encoding, the <att>who</att> attribute has been used for this
purpose; <att>xml:id</att> attributes have also been added.
The <att>xml:id</att> values specified allow us to link the material
spoken by each voice:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text xml:id="zuitxt">
   <body>
      <p>Zui-Gan called out to himself every day,
         <q next="#zuiq2" xml:id="zuiq1" who="zuigan">Master.</q></p>
      <p>Then he answered himself,
         <q next="#zuiq4" xml:id="zuiq2" who="zuigan">Yes, sir.</q></p>
      <p>And then he added,
         <q next="#zuiq5" xml:id="zuiq3" who="master">Become sober.</q></p>
      <p>Again he answered,
         <q next="#zuiq7" xml:id="zuiq4" who="zuigan">Yes, sir.</q></p>
      <p><q next="#zuiq6" xml:id="zuiq5" who="master">And after that,</q>
         he continued,
         <q xml:id="zuiq6" who="master">do not be deceived by others.</q></p>
      <p><q xml:id="zuiq7" who="zuigan">Yes, sir; yes, sir,</q>
         he replied.</p>
   </body>
</text></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">However, by using the <gi>join</gi> element, we can directly
represent the complete speech attributed to each voice:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><joinGrp result="q">
   <join targets="#zuiq1 #zuiq2 #zuiq4 #zuiq7">
    <desc>what Zui-Gan said</desc></join>
   <join targets="#zuiq3 #zuiq5 #zuiq6"> 
     <desc>what Master said</desc></join>
</joinGrp></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Note the use of the <gi>desc</gi> child element within the two
<gi>join</gi>s making up the <gi>q</gi> element here. These enable us
to  document the speakers of the two virtual <gi>q</gi> elements
represented by the <gi>join</gi> elements; this is necessary because the
current proposals do not allow for any way of specifying the attributes
to be associated with a virtual element, and hence we cannot specify a
<att>who</att> value for them.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Suppose now that <att>xml:id</att> attributes, for whatever
reasons, are not available. Then <gi>ptr</gi> elements may be created
using any of the methods described in sections <ptr target="#SAES"/>
or <ptr target="#SATS"/>. The <att>xml:id</att> attributes of
<emph>these</emph> elements may now be specified by the

<head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Alternation</head>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This section proposes elements for the representation of alternation.
We say that two or more elements are in <term>exclusive
alternation</term> if any of those elements could be present in a text,
but one and only one of them is; in addition, we say that those elements
are <term>mutually exclusive</term>. We say that the elements are in
<term>inclusive alternation</term> if at least one (and possibly more)
of them is present. The elements that are in alternation may also be
called <term>alternants</term>.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The need to mark exclusive alternation arises frequently in text
encoding. A common situation is one in which it can determined that
exactly one of several different words appears in a given location, but
it cannot be determined which one. One way to mark such an exclusive
alternation is to use the linking attribute <att>exclude</att>. Having
marked an exclusive alternation, it can sometimes later be determined
which of the alternants actually appears in the given location. To
preserve the fact that an alternation was posited, one can add the
linking attribute <att>select</att> to a tag which hierarchically
encompasses the alternants, which points to the one which actually
appears. To assign responsibility and degree of certainty to the
choice, one can use the <gi>certainty</gi> tag described in
chapter <ptr target="#CE"/>. Also see that chapter for further discussion of
certainty in general.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <att>exclude</att> and <att>select</att> attributes may be used
with any element assuming that they have been declared following the
procedure discussed in the introduction to this chapter.
 <specList>
   <specDesc key="att.global.linking"/>
</specList></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A more general way to mark alternation, encompassing both exclusive
and inclusive alternation, is to use the linking element <gi>alt</gi>.
The description and attributes of this tag and of the associated
grouping tag <gi>altGrp</gi> are as follows. These elements are also
members of the <ident type="class">att.pointing</ident> class and therefore
have all the attributes associated with that class.
<specList><specDesc key="alt" atts="targets weights"/><specDesc key="altGrp"/></specList></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To take a simple hypothetical example, suppose in transcribing a
spoken text, we encounter an utterance that we can understand either as
<mentioned>We had fun at the beach today.</mentioned> or as <mentioned>We had sun at
the beach today.</mentioned> We can represent the exclusive alternation of
these two possibilities by means of the <att>exclude</att> attribute as
follows.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="interview">
  <u exclude="#we.sun1" xml:id="we.fun1">We had fun at the beach today.</u>
  <u exclude="#we.fun1" xml:id="we.sun1">We had sun at the beach today.</u>
</div></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">If it is then determined that the speaker said <mentioned>fun</mentioned>,
not <mentioned>sun</mentioned>, the encoder could amend the text by deleting the
alternant containing <mentioned>sun</mentioned> and the <att>exclude</att>
attribute on the remaining alternant. Alternatively, the encoder could
preserve the fact that there was uncertainty in the original
transcription by retaining the alternants, and assigning the
<val>we.fun</val> value to the <att>select</att> attribute value on the <tag>div</tag> tag that
encompasses the alternants, as in:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div select="#we.fun2" type="interview">
   <u exclude="#we.sun2" xml:id="we.fun2">We had fun at the beach today.</u>
   <u exclude="#we.fun2" xml:id="we.sun2">We had sun at the beach today.</u>
</div></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The above alternation (including the <att>select</att> attribute)
could be recoded by assigning the <att>exclude</att> attributes to tags
that enclose just the words or even the characters that are mutually
exclusive, as in:<note place="foot">See section <ptr target="#AILC"/> for discussion of the
<tag>w</tag> and <tag>c</tag> tags that can be used in the following
examples instead of the <tag>seg type="word"</tag> and <tag>seg
type="character"</tag> tags.</note>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="interview">
  <u select="#fun3">We had
    <seg exclude="#sun3" xml:id="fun3" type="word">fun</seg>
    <seg exclude="#fun3" xml:id="sun3" type="word">sun</seg>
    at the beach today.</u>
</div></egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="interview">
  <u>We had
    <seg select="#f" type="word">
      <seg exclude="#s" xml:id="f" type="character">f</seg>
      <seg exclude="#f" xml:id="s" type="character">s</seg>
      un</seg>
    at the beach today.</u>
</div></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now suppose that the transcriber is uncertain whether the first word
in the utterance is <mentioned>We</mentioned> or <mentioned>Lee</mentioned>, but is
certain that if it is <mentioned>Lee</mentioned>, then the other uncertain word
is definitely <mentioned>fun</mentioned> and not <mentioned>sun</mentioned>. The three
utterances that are in mutual exclusion can be encoded as follows.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="interview">
  <!-- ... -->
  <u exclude="#we.sun4 #lee.fun4" xml:id="we.fun4">We had fun at the beach today.</u>
  <u exclude="#we.fun4 #lee.fun4" xml:id="we.sun4">We had sun at the beach today.</u>
  <u exclude="#we.fun4 #we.sun4" xml:id="lee.fun4">Lee had fun at the beach today.</u>
  <!-- ... -->
</div></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The preceding example can also be encoded with <att>exclude</att>
attributes on the word segments <mentioned>We</mentioned>, <mentioned>Lee</mentioned>,
<mentioned>fun</mentioned> and <mentioned>sun</mentioned>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u>
  <seg exclude="#lee" xml:id="we" type="word">We</seg>
  <seg exclude="#we #sun" xml:id="lee" type="word">Lee</seg>
  had
  <seg exclude="#sun" xml:id="fun" type="word">fun</seg>
  <seg exclude="#fun #lee" xml:id="sun" type="word">sun</seg>
  at the beach today.</u></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The value of the <att>select</att> attribute is defined as a list of
identifiers (<ident type="kw">IDREFS</ident>); hence it can also be used to
narrow down the range of alternants, as in:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div select="#we.fun5 #lee.fun5" type="interview">
  <u exclude="#we.sun5 #lee.fun5" xml:id="we.fun5">We had fun at the beach today.</u>
  <u exclude="#we.fun5 #lee.fun5" xml:id="we.sun5">We had sun at the beach today.</u>
  <u exclude="#we.fun5 #we.sun5" xml:id="lee.fun5">Lee had fun at the beach today.</u>
</div></egXML>
This is interpreted to mean that either the first or the third
<tag>u</tag> tag appears, and is thus equivalent to just the alternation
of those two tags:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="interview">
  <u exclude="#lee.fun6" xml:id="we.fun6">We had fun at the beach today.</u>
  <u exclude="#we.fun6" xml:id="lee.fun6">Lee had fun at the beach today.</u>
</div></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <att>exclude</att> attribute can also be used in case there is
uncertainty about the tag that appears in a certain position. For
example, the occurrence of the word <mentioned>May</mentioned> in the S-unit
<mentioned>Let's go to May</mentioned> can be interpreted, in the absence of
other information, either as a person's name or as a date. The
uncertainty can be rendered as follows, using the <att>exclude</att>
attribute.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><s>Let's go to
<name exclude="#mayn" xml:id="mayd">May</name>
   <date copyOf="#mayd" exclude="#mayd" xml:id="mayn"/>.</s></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Note the use of the <att>copyOf</att> attribute discussed in
section <ptr target="#SAIE"/>; this avoids having to repeat the content of the
element whose correct tagging is in doubt.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <att>copyOf</att> and the <att>exclude</att> attributes also
provide for a simple way of indicating uncertainty about exactly where a
particular element occurs in a document.<note place="foot">An alternative way of
representing this problem is discussed in chapter <ptr target="#CE"/>.</note>

For example suppose that a particular <gi>div2</gi>
element appears either as the third and last of the <gi>div2</gi>
elements within the first <tag>div1</tag> element in the body of a
document, or as the first <gi>div2</gi> of the second <gi>div1</gi>.
One solution would be to record the <gi>div2</gi> in its entirety in the
first of these positions, and a virtual copy of it in the second, and
mark them as excluding each other as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body>
        <div1 xml:id="C1">
                <div2 xml:id="C1S3" exclude="#c2s1">
                </div2>
        </div1>
        <div1 xml:id="C2">
                <div2 xml:id="C2S1" copyOf="#c1s3" exclude="#c1s3"/>
        </div1>
</body></egXML>
In this case, the <att>select</att> attribute, if used, would appear on
the <tag>body</tag> tag.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mutual exclusion can also be expressed using a <tag>link</tag>; the
first example in this section can be recoded by removing the
<att>exclude</att> attributes from the <tag>u</tag> tags, and adding a
<tag>link</tag> as follows:<note place="foot">In this example, we have
placed the <tag>link</tag> next to the tags that represent the
alternants. It could also have been placed elsewhere in the document,
perhaps within a <tag>linkGrp</tag>. </note>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="interview">
  <u xml:id="we.had.fun">We had fun at the beach today.</u>
  <u xml:id="we.had.sun">We had sun at the beach today.</u>
  <link type="exclusive_alternation" targets="#we.had.fun #we.had.sun"/>
</div></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Now we define the specialized linking element <gi>alt</gi>, making
it a member of the pointer class of elements, and assigning it a
<att>excl</att> (for <mentioned>mutually exclusive</mentioned>)
attribute, which can have either of the values <val>Y</val> or <val>N</val>. Then the
following equivalence holds:
<eg><![CDATA[<alt mode="excl"/> = <link type="exclusive alternation"/>]]></eg></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The
preceding <tag>link</tag> may therefore be recoded as the following
<tag>alt</tag> element.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><alt targets="#we.fun #we.sun" mode="excl"/></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Other attributes that are defined specifically for the <gi>alt</gi>
element are <att>weights</att> and <att>percent</att>. The
<att>weights</att> attribute is to be used if one wishes to assign
<term>probabilistic weights</term> to the targets (alternants). Its
value is a list of numbers, corresponding to the targets, expressing the
probability that each target appears. <!--The <att>percent</att> attribute
is used to indicate whether the weights are stated as percentages
(<code>percent="Y"</code>, the default) or as the actual probabilities
(<code>percent="N"</code>)--> If the alternants are mutually exclusive, then
the weights must sum to 1.0.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Suppose in the preceding example that it is equiprobable whether
<mentioned>fun</mentioned> or <mentioned>sun</mentioned> appears. Then the
<tag>alt</tag> that represents the alternation may be stated as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><alt targets="#we.fun #we.sun" mode="excl" weights="0.5 0.5"/></egXML></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The assignment of a weight of 1.0 to one target (and weights of 0
to all the others) is equivalent to selecting that target. Thus the
following encoding is equivalent to the second example at the beginning
of this section.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><u xml:id="we.fun">We had fun at the beach today.</u><![CDATA[

<!-- 
<p>Inclusive alternation can only be expressed by the    -->
        <!-- use of a linking element, either a <tag>link             -->

        <!-- 
<p>For inclusive alternation, the <att>weights</att>     -->
        <!-- attribute works as follows:  each weight states the      -->

        <!-- example, suppose that the probability that the           -->
        <!-- <tag>div2</tag> appears in the first position given      -->
        <!-- that it appears in the second position is 20%, but that  -->
        <!-- the probability that it appears in the second position   -->
        <!-- given that it appears in the first position is 0%.       -->
        <!-- Then the preceding <tag>alt</tag> tag can be revised to  -->

        <!-- ]]> -->
        <!-- </eg> -->
The sum of the weights for <tag>alt excl="N"</tag> tags ranges from 0% to
(100 × <code>k</code>)%, where <code>k</code> is the number of targets. If the sum is 0%, then
the alternation is equivalent to exclusive alternation; if the sum is
(100 x k)%, then all of the alternants must appear, and the situation is
better encoded without an <tag>alt</tag> tag.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">If it is desired, <gi>alt</gi> elements may be grouped together in an
<gi>altGrp</gi> element, and attribute values shared by the individual
<gi>alt</gi> elements may be identified on the <gi>altGrp</gi> element. The
<att>targFunc</att> attribute defaults to the value <val>first.alternant next.alternant</val>. Thus, specifying
the value <val>2</val> for the <att>extendTarg</att> attribute   permits the alternants to be
extended indefinitely.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">To illustrate, consider again the example of a transcribed utterance,
in which it is uncertain whether the first word is <mentioned>We</mentioned> or
<mentioned>Lee</mentioned>, whether the third word is <mentioned>fun</mentioned> or
<mentioned>sun</mentioned>, but that if the first word is <mentioned>Lee</mentioned>,
then the third word is <mentioned>fun</mentioned>. Now suppose we have the
following additional information: if <mentioned>we</mentioned> occurs, then the
probability that <mentioned>fun</mentioned> occurs is 50% and that
<mentioned>sun</mentioned> occurs is 50%; if <mentioned>fun</mentioned> occurs, then the
probability that <mentioned>we</mentioned> occurs is 40% and that
<mentioned>Lee</mentioned> occurs is 60%. This situation can be encoded as
follows.

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">From the information in this encoding, we can determine that the

	<head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Introduction</head>

    <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Most of the mechanisms defined in this chapter rely to a
    greater or lesser extent on the fact that tags in a marked-up
    document can both assert a property for a span of text which they
    enclose, and assert the existence of an association between
    themselves and some other span of text elsewhere. In stand-off
    markup, there is a clear separation of these two behaviours: the
    markup does not directly contain any part of the text, but
    instead includes it by reference. One specific mechanism
    recommended by these Guidelines for this purpose is the standard
    XInclude mechanism defined by the W3C; another is to use pointers
    as demonstrated elsewhere in this chapter. </p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There are many reasons for using stand-off markup: the source
	  text might be read-only so that additional markup cannot be added,
          or a single text may need to be marked up
          according to several hierarchically incompatible schemes, or a single
          scheme may need to accomodate multiple hierarchical ambiguities, so that
          a single markup tree is not the most faithful representation of the
          source material.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This section describes a generic mechanism for expressing
	  <emph>all</emph> kinds of markup externally as stand-off tags, for use
          whenever it is appropriate.</p>
<!-- this list uses technical terms defined after it appears: it
should be moved -->
	<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Throughout this section the following terms will be systematically used in
	specific senses.
<list type="gloss">
	<label>
<term>source document</term>
	</label>
	<item>a document to which the stand-off markup refers (a source document can be either XML or
plain text); there may be more than one source document.</item>
	<label>
<term>internal markup</term>
	</label>
	<item>markup that is already present in an XML source document</item>
	<label>
<term>stand-off markup</term>
	</label>
	<item>markup that is either outside of the source document and points in to it to the data it
describes, or alternatively is in another part of the source document and points elsewhere
within the document to the data it describes</item>
	<label>
<term>external document</term>
	</label>
	<item>a document that contains stand-off markup that points to a different, source document</item>
	<label>
<term>internalize</term>
	</label>
	<item>the action of creating a new XML document with external markup and data integrated with the
source document data, and possibly some source document markup as well</item>
	<label>
<term>externalize</term>
	</label>
	<item>a process applied to markup from a pre-existing XML document, which splits it into two
documents, an XML (external) document containing some of the markup of the original document,
and another (source) XML document containing whatever text content and markup has not been
extracted into the stand-off document; if all markup has been externalized from a document, the
new source may be a plain text document</item>
</list>
	</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The three major requirements satisfied by this scheme for stand-off markup are:
	  <list>
	    <item n="a">any valid TEI markup can be either internal or
	      external,</item>
	    <item n="b">external markup can be internalized by
	      applying it to the document content by either
	      substituting the existing markup or adding to it,

   <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Stand-off markup which relies on the  inclusion of

	       Recommendation dated <date value="2004-12-20">20 December

	  (<mentioned>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</mentioned>),
	  which in these Guidelines will be associated with the prefix 
	  <mentioned>xi:</mentioned>, and exactly two elements,
	  <gi>xi:include</gi> and <gi>xi:fallback</gi>. XInclude
	  relies on the <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/">XPointer
	  framework</ref> discussed elsewhere in this chapter
	  to point to the actual fragments of text to be
	  internalized. Although
	  XInclude only requires support for the <ref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/"><code>element()</code></ref> 
	  scheme of XPointer, these Guidelines permit the use of any of the
pointing  schemes discussed in section <ptr target="#SAXP"/>.</p>
 
	<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">XInclude is a W3C recommendation which specifies a syntax for the
	  inclusion within an XML document of data fragments placed in
	  different resources. Included resources can be either plain
	  text or XML. XInclude instructions within an XML document
	  are meant to be replaced by a resource being pointed at by a
	  URI, possibly augmented by an XPointer that identifies the
	  exact subresource to be included. Fallback content or
	  resources can be specified in case of a failure to fetch the
	  requested resource. </p>

	  <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi>xi:include</gi> element uses the <att>href</att>
	  attribute to specify the location of the resource to be
	  included; its value is an IURI <!-- this is the only
	  occurence of "IURI" in the Guidelines; does it need to be
	  explained?, or is it an error?-->containing, if necessary,
	  an XPointer. Additionally, it uses the <att>parse</att>
	  attribute (whose only valid values are <val>text</val> and
	  <val>xml</val>) to specify whether the included content is
	  plain text or an XML fragment, and the <att>encoding</att>
	  attribute to provide a hint, when the included fragment is
	  text, of the character encoding of the fragment. An optional
	  <gi>xi:fallback</gi> element is also permitted within an
	  <gi>xi:include</gi>; it specifies alternative content to be
	  used when the external resource cannot be fetched for some
	  reason. Its use is not however recommended for stand-off
	  markup.</p>
 
	  <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">XInclude currently only requires support for one XPointer
	  scheme, called <code>element()</code>. As described in <ptr target="#SAES"/>, the <code>element()</code> scheme can use
	  either a bare name (denoting an element with a specific
	  <att>xml:id</att> attribute) or a child sequence (a
	  numerical sequence of slash-separated child numbers
	  specifying a path in the XML tree whose final step selects a
	  specific subtree of XML content) to specify its
	  target. Another scheme, <code>xpointer()</code>, has not yet
	  become a W3C recommendation, although it has been part of
	  the XPointer drafts from the beginning. The
	  <code>xpointer()</code> scheme and the TEI schemes defined
	  earlier (see <ptr target="#SATS"/>) add the concepts of
	  points and ranges, which can be used to specify sub-node
	  fragments (e.g., a few words within a longer text node) or
	  trans-node fragments (e.g., a segment of text that spans
	  across different branches of the overall XML tree).</p>

	<head xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Doing stand-off markup in TEI</head>

     <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The operations of internalizing and externalizing markup are
     very useful and practically important. XInclude processing as
     defined by the W3C <emph>is</emph> internalization of one or more
     source documents' content into a stand-off document. TEI use of
     XInclude for stand-off markup enables use of XInclude-conformant
     sofware to perform this useful operation. However,
     internalization is not clearly defined for all stand-off files,
     because the structure of the internal and external markup trees
     may overlap. In particular, when an external markup document
     selects a range that overlaps partial elements in the source
     document, it is not clear how the semantics of internalization
     (inclusion) should work, since partial elements are not XML
     objects.  <note place="foot">This corresponds to the observation
     that overlapping XML tags reflecting a textual version of such an
     inclusion would not even be well-formed XML. This kind of overlap
     in textual phenomena of interest is in fact the major reason that
     stand-off markup is needed.</note> XInclude defines a semantics
     for this case that involves only complete elements.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">When a range selection partially overlaps a number of elements in a
source document, XInclude specifies that the partially overlapping
elements should be included as well as all completely overlapping
elements and characters (partially overlapping characters are not
possible). The effect of this is that elements that straddle the start
or end of a selected range will be included as wrappers for those of
their children that are completely or partially selected by the
range. For example, given the following source document:
 
        <eg><![CDATA[
        <body>
  <p xml:id="par1">home, <emph>home</emph> on Brokeback Mountain.</p>
  <p xml:id="par2">That was the <emph>song</emph> that I sang</p>
  </body>
        ]]></eg>
        and the following external document:
        <eg><![CDATA[
  <body xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
     <div><xi:include href="example1.xml"
xpointer="range(xpath1(id(par1)//emph),xpath1(id(par2)//emph))"/>
     </div>
 </body>    ]]></eg>
        the resulting document after XInclude processing of this external document
        would be:
        <eg><![CDATA[
   <body xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
   <div>
      <p xml:id="par1"><emph>home</emph> on Brokeback Mountain.</p>
      <p xml:id="par2">That was the <emph>song</emph></p>    
   </div>
   </body>
        ]]></eg>

        The result of the inclusion is two paragraph elements, while
        the original range designated in the the source document
        overlapped two paragraph fragments. 
<!-- what if it were a TEI join -->

The semantics of XInclude require the creation of well-formed XML results even though
        the  pointing mechanisms it uses do not necessarily
        respect the hierarchical structure of XML documents, as in
	this case. While
        this is a good way to ensure that internalization is always
        possible, it has implications for the use of XInclude as a
        notation for the <emph>description</emph> of overlapping
        markup structures.
        </p>
        
        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><!--Overlapping markup cannot be represented by a source
        document combined with an external document using XInclude to
        impose elements that overlap those in the original
        document. -->When overlapping hierarchies need to be represented
        for a single document, each hierarchy must be represented by a
        separate set of XInclude tags pointing to a common source
        document. This sort of structure corresponds to common
        practice in work with linguistic text corpora. In such corpora, each
        potentially overlapping hierarchy of elements for the text is
        represented as a separate stream of stand-off
        markup. Generally the source text contains markup for features
        of the smallest significant units of analysis in the corpus,
        such as words or morphemes, this information and its markup
        representing a layer of common information that is shared by
        all the various hierarchies. As a way of organizing the
        representation of complex data, this technique generally
        allows a large number of <att>xml:id</att> attributes to be
        attached to the shared elements, providing robust anchors for
        links and facilitating adjustments to the source document
        without breaking external documents that reference it.

	<!-- example please -->

        <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Any tag can be externalized by
<!-- this example is too simple: move it earlier -->
	  removing its content and replacing it with an 
	  <gi>xi:include</gi> element that contains an XPointer

	<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For instance the following portion of a TEI document:

	<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Please note that this specification requires that the
	XInclude namespace declaration is present in all cases. The
	<gi>xi:fallback</gi> element contains text or XML fragments to
	be placed in the document if the inclusion fails for any
	reason (for instance due to inaccessibility of an external
	resource). The <gi>xi:fallback</gi> element is optional; if it

	  internalized document.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">While a TEI customization may permit
       <gi>xi:include</gi> elements in various places in a TEI document
