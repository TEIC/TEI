<head>Dictionaries</head>

<p>This chapter defines a module for encoding lexical resources of all
kinds, in particular human-oriented
monolingual and multilingual dictionaries, glossaries, and similar
documents. The elements described here may also be useful in the
encoding of computational lexica and similar resources intended for
use by language-processing software; they may also be used to provide
a rich encoding for wordlists, lexica, glossaries, etc. included
within other documents.  Dictionaries are most familiar in
their printed form; however, increasing numbers of dictionaries exist
also in electronic forms which are independent of any particular
printed form, but from which various displays can be produced. </p>

<p>Both typographically and structurally, print dictionaries are
extremely complex. Such lexical resources are moreover of interest to
many communities with different and sometimes conflicting goals. As a
result, many general problems of text encoding are particularly
pronounced here, and more compromises and alternatives within the
encoding scheme may be required in the future.<note place="bottom">We
refer the reader to previous and current discussions of a common
format for encoding lexical resources. For example, <ptr type="cit"
target="#DI-BIBL-1"/>; <ptr type="cit" target="#DI-BIBL-2"/>;<ptr
type="cit" target="#DI-BIBL-3"/>; <ptr type="cit"
target="#DI-BIBL-4"/>; <ptr type="cit" target="#DI-BIBL-5"/>; <ptr
type="cit" target="#DI-BIBL-6"/>; <ptr type="cit"
target="#DI-BIBL-7"/>; and <ptr type="cit" target="#DI-BIBL-8"/>; <ptr
type="cit" target="#DI-BIBL-9"/>.</note> Two problems are particularly
prominent.</p>

<p>First, because the structure of dictionary entries varies widely
both among and within dictionaries, the simplest way for an encoding
scheme to accommodate the entire range of structures actually
encountered is to allow virtually any element to appear virtually
anywhere in a dictionary entry. It is clear, however, that strong and
consistent structural principles do govern the vast majority of
conventional dictionaries, as well as many or most entries even in
more <soCalled>exotic</soCalled> dictionaries; 
encoding guidelines should include these structural principles. We
therefore define two distinct elements for dictionary entries, one
(<gi>entry</gi>) which captures the regularities of many conventional
dictionary entries, and a second (<gi>entryFree</gi>) which uses the
same elements, but allows them to combine much more freely. It is
however recommended that <gi>entry</gi> be used in preference to
<gi>entryFree</gi> wherever possible.
These elements and their contents are described in sections <ptr target="#DIEN"/>, <ptr target="#DIFR"/>, and <ptr target="#DIHW"/>.</p>

<p>Second, since so much of the information in printed dictionaries is
implicit or highly compressed, their encoding requires clear thought
about whether it is to capture the precise typographic form of the
source text or the underlying structure of the information it
presents. Since both of these views of the dictionary may be of
interest, it proves necessary to develop methods of recording both,
and of recording the interrelationship between them as well. Users
interested mainly in the printed format of the dictionary will require
an encoding to be faithful to an original printed version. However,
other users will be interested primarily in capturing the lexical
information in a dictionary in a form suitable for further processing,
which may demand the expansion or rearrangement of the information
contained in the printed form. Further, some users wish to encode
<emph>both</emph> of these views of the data, and retain the links
between related elements of the two encodings. Problems of recording
these two different views of dictionary data are discussed in section
<ptr target="#DIMV"/>, together with mechanisms for retaining both
views when this is desired.</p>

<p>To deal with this complexity, and in particular to account for the
wide variety of linguistic contexts within which a dictionary may be
designed, it can be necessary to customize or change the schema by
providing more restriction or possibly alternate content models for
the elements defined in this chapter.  Section <ptr target="#DITPGR"/>
illustrates this with the provision of a closed set of values for
grammatical descriptors.</p>

<p>This chapter contains a large number of examples taken from
existing print dictionaries; in each case, the original source is
identified. In presenting such examples, we have tried to retain the
original typographic appearance of the example as well as presenting a
suggested encoding for it. Where this has not been possible (for
example in the display of pronounciation) we have adopted the
transliteration found in the electronic edition of the <title>Oxford
Advanced Learner's Dictionary</title>. Also, the middle dot in quoted
entries is rendered with a full stop, while within the sample
transcriptions hyphenation and syllabification points are indicated by
a vertical bar |, regardless of their appearance in the source
text.</p>

<div type="div2" xml:id="DIBO">
<head>Dictionary Body and Overall Structure</head>

<p>Overall, dictionaries have the same structure of front matter,
body, and back matter familiar from other texts. In addition,
this module defines <gi>entry</gi>, <gi>entryFree</gi>,
and <gi>superEntry</gi> as component-level elements which can occur
directly within a text division or the text body. </p>

<p>The following tags can therefore be used to mark the gross structure of a
printed dictionary; the dictionary-specific tags are discussed further
in the following section.<specList>
<specDesc key="text"/>
<specDesc key="front"/>
<specDesc key="body"/>
<specDesc key="back"/>
<specDesc key="div"/>
<specDesc key="entry"/>
<specDesc key="entryFree"/>
<specDesc key="superEntry"/>
</specList></p>

<p>As members of the classes <ident type="class">att.entryLike</ident> and 
 <ident type="class">att.sortable</ident>,
<gi>entry</gi> and <gi>entryFree</gi> share the following
attributes:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.entryLike" atts="type"/>  
 <specDesc key="att.sortable" atts="sortKey"/> 
</specList>
</p>

<p>The front and back matter of a dictionary may well contain
specialized material such as lists of common and proper nouns,
grammatical tables, gazetteers, a <soCalled>guide to the use of the
dictionary</soCalled>, etc. These should be tagged using elements
defined elsewhere in these Guidelines, chiefly in the core module
(chapter <ptr target="#CO"/>) together with the specialized dictionary
elements defined in this chapter.</p>

<p>The <gi>body</gi> element consists of a set of
<term>entries</term>, optionally grouped into one or several
<gi>div</gi> elements. These text divisions might correspond, for
example, sections for different letters of the alphabet, or to
sections for different languages in bilingual dictionaries, as in the
following example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<body>
<div><head>English-French</head>
<entry><form><orth>cat</orth></form><!-- ... --></entry>
<entry><form><orth>dog</orth></form><!-- ... --></entry>
<entry><form><orth>horse</orth></form><!-- ... --></entry>
</div>
<div>
<head>French-English</head>
<entry><form><orth>chat</orth></form><!-- ... --></entry>
<entry><form><orth>chien</orth></form><!-- ... --></entry>
<entry><form><orth>cheval</orth></form><!-- ... --></entry>
</div>
</body>
</egXML>
</p><!-- why both same type? -->

<p>In a
print dictionary, the entries are typically typographically distinct
entities, each headed by some morphological form of the lexical item
described (the <term>headword</term>), and sorted in alphabetical
order or (especially for non-alphabetic scripts) in some other
conventional sequence. Dictionary entries should be encoded as
distinct successive items, each marked as an <gi>entry</gi> or
<gi>entryFree</gi> element. The <att>type</att> attribute may be used
to distinguish different types of entries, for example main entries,
related entries, run-on entries, or entries for cross-references,
etc. </p>

<p>Some dictionaries provide distinct entries for homographs, on the
basis of etymology, part-of-speech, or both, and typically provide a
numeric superscript on the headword identifying the homograph
number. In these cases each homograph should be encoded as a separate
entry; the <gi>superEntry</gi> element may optionally be used to group
such successive homograph entries. In addition to a series of
<gi>entry</gi> elements, the <gi>superEntry</gi> may contain a
preliminary <gi>form</gi> group (see section <ptr target="#DITPFO"/>)
when information about hyphenation, pronunciation, etc., is given only
once for two or more homograph entries. If the homograph number is to
be recorded, the global attribute <att>n</att> may be used for this
purpose. In some dictionaries, homographs are treated in distinct
parts of the same entry; in these cases, they may be separated by use
of the <gi>hom</gi> element, for which see section <ptr target="#DIENHI"/>. </p>

<p>A sort key, given in the <att>sortKey</att> attribute, is often
required for superentries and entries, especially in cases where the
order of entries does not follow the local character-set collating
sequence (as, for example, when an entry for <q>3D</q> appears at the
place where <q>three-D</q> would appear). </p>



<p>A dictionary with no internal divisions might thus have a structure like
the following; a <gi>superEntry</gi> is shown grouping two homograph
entries.<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<head>The Structure of Dictionary Entries</head>

<p>A simple dictionary entry may contain information about the form of
the word treated, its grammatical characterization, its definition,
synonyms, or translation equivalents, its etymology, cross-references
to other entries, usage information, and examples. These we refer to
as the <term>constituent parts</term> or <term>constituents</term> of
the entry; some dictionary constituents possess no internal structure,
while others are most naturally viewed as groups of smaller elements,
which may be marked in their own right.  In some styles of markup,
tags will be applied only to the low-level items, leaving the
constituent groups which contain them untagged. We distinguish the
class of <term>top-level constituents</term> of dictionary entries,
which can occur directly within the <gi>entry</gi> element, from the class of
<term>phrase-level</term> constituents, which can normally occur only
within top-level constituents. The top-level constituents of
dictionary entries are described in section <ptr target="#DIENGP"/>,
and documented more fully, together with their phrase-level
sub-constituents, in section <ptr target="#DITP"/>. </p>

<p>In addition, however, dictionary entries often have a complex
hierarchical structure. For example, an entry may consist of two or
more sub-parts, each corresponding to information for a different
part-of-speech homograph of the headword. The entry (or part-of-speech
homographs, if the entry is split this way) may also consist of
senses, each of which may in turn be composed of two or more
sub-senses, etc. Each sub-part, homograph entry, sense, or sub-sense
we call a <term>level</term>; at any level in an entry, any or all of
the constituent parts of dictionary entries may appear. The
hierarchical levels of dictionary entries are documented in section
<ptr target="#DIENHI"/>. </p>

<div type="div3" xml:id="DIENHI">
<head>Hierarchical Levels</head>

<p>The outermost structural level of an entry is marked with the
elements <gi>entry</gi> or <gi>entryFree</gi>. The <gi>hom</gi>
element marks the subdivision of entries into homographs differing in
their part-of-speech. The <gi>sense</gi> element marks the subdivision
of entries and part-of-speech homographs into senses; this element
nests recursively in order to provide for a hierarchy of sub-senses of
any depth.  It is recommended to use the <gi>sense</gi> element even 
for an entry that has only one sense to group together all parts of 
the definition relating to the word sense since this leads to more 
consistent encoding across entries. 
All of these levels may each contain any of the
constituent parts of an entry. A special case of hierarchical
structure is represented by the <gi>re</gi> (related entry) element,
which is discussed in section <ptr target="#DITPRE"/>. Finally, the
element <gi>dictScrap</gi> may be used at any point in the hierarchy
to delimit parts of the dictionary entry which are structurally
anomalous, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#DIFR"/>.<specList>
<specDesc key="entry"/>
<specDesc key="entryFree"/>
<specDesc key="hom"/>
<specDesc key="sense" atts="level"/>
<specDesc key="dictScrap"/>
</specList>
</p>
 <p>For example, an entry with two senses will have the following structure:<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry>
<sense n="1"/>
<sense n="2"/>
</entry>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>An entry with two homographs, the first with two senses and the second with three
 (one of which has two sub-senses), may have a structure like this:<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry>
<hom n="1">
<sense n="1"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
<sense n="2"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
</hom>
<hom n="2">
<sense n="1">
<sense n="a"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
<sense n="b"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
</sense>
<sense n="2"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
<sense n="3"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
</hom>
</entry>
</egXML> In some dictionaries, homographs have separate entries; in
such a case, as noted in section <ptr target="#DIBO"/>, the two homographs may be
 treated as entries, optionally grouped in a <gi>superEntry</gi>:<egXML xml:lang="und" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<superEntry>
<entry n="1" type="hom">
<sense n="1"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
<sense n="2"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
</entry>
<entry n="2" type="hom">
<sense n="1">
<sense n="a"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
<sense n="b"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
</sense>
<sense n="2"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
<sense n="3"> <!-- ... --> </sense>
</entry>
</superEntry>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The hierarchic structure of a dictionary entry is enforced by the
structures defined in this module. The content model for
<gi>entry</gi> specifies that entries do not nest, that homographs
nest within entries, and that senses nest within entries, homographs,
or senses, and may be nested to any depth to reflect the embedding of
sub-senses. Any of the top-level constituents (<gi>def</gi>,
<gi>usg</gi>, <gi>form</gi>, etc.) can appear at any level (i.e.,
within entries, homographs, or senses).<specGrp xml:id="DDIEN" n="Dictionary entries and their structure">

<div type="div3" xml:id="DIENGP">
<head>Groups and Constituents</head>

<p>As noted above, dictionary entries, and subordinate levels within dictionary entries,
may comprise several constituent parts, each providing a different type of
information about the word treated. The <term>top-level constituents</term> of
dictionary entries are:<list type="simple">
<item>information about the form of the word treated (orthography,
pronunciation, hyphenation, etc.)</item>
<item>grammatical information (part of speech, grammatical sub-categorization,
etc.)</item>
<item>definitions or translations into another language</item>
<item>etymology</item>
<item>examples</item>
<item>usage information</item>
<item>cross-references to other entries</item>
<item>notes</item>
<item>entries (often of reduced form) for related words, typically called
<term>related entries</term>
</item>
</list> Any of the hierarchical levels (<gi>entry</gi>, <gi>entryFree</gi>,
<gi>hom</gi>, and <gi>sense</gi>) may contain any of these top-level constituents, since
information about word form, particular grammatical information, special
pronunciation, usage information, etc., may apply to an entire entry, or to only one
homograph, or only to a particular sense. The examples below illustrate this point. </p>
<p>The following elements are used to encode these top-level constituents:<specList>
<specDesc key="form"/>
<specDesc key="gramGrp"/>
<specDesc key="def"/>
<specDesc key="cit"/>
<specDesc key="usg"/>
<specDesc key="xr"/>
<specDesc key="etym"/>
<specDesc key="re"/>
<specDesc key="note"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>In a simple entry with no internal hierarchy, all top-level constituents can appear 
as children of <gi>entry</gi>.<!--

<head>Information on Written and Spoken Forms</head>
<p>Dictionary entries most often begin with information about the form of the word to
which the entry applies. Typically, the orthographic form of the word, sometimes
marked for syllabification or hyphenation, is the first item in an entry. Other
information about the word, including variant or alternate forms, inflected forms,
pronunciation, etc., is also often given. </p>
<p>The following elements should be used to encode this information: the <gi>form</gi>
element groups one or more occurrences of any of them; it can also be
recursively nested to reflect more complex sub-grouping of information about word
form(s), as shown in the examples.<specList>
<specDesc key="form" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="orth" atts="type extent"/>
<specDesc key="pron" atts="extent"/>
<specDesc key="hyph"/>
<specDesc key="syll"/>
<specDesc key="stress"/>
<specDesc key="lbl"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>In addition to those listed above, the following elements, which encode morphological
details of the form, may also occur within <gi>form</gi> elements:<specList>
<specDesc key="gram" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="gen"/>
<specDesc key="number"/>
<specDesc key="case"/>
<specDesc key="per"/>
<specDesc key="tns"/>
<specDesc key="mood"/>
<specDesc key="iType" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="pos"/>
<specDesc key="subc"/>
<specDesc key="colloc"/>
</specList> Of these, the <gi>gram</gi> element is most general, and all of the
others are synonymous with a <gi>gram</gi> element with appropriate values (<val>gen,
number, case</val>, etc.) for the <att>type</att> attribute.</p>
<p>Different dictionaries use different means to mark hyphenation,
syllabification, and stress, and they often use some unusual glyphs
(e.g., the <soCalled>middle dot</soCalled> for hyphenation). All of
these glyphs are in the Unicode character set, as discussed in <ptr target="#SG-er"/>. When transcribing representations of pronunciation
the International Phonetic Alphabet should be used. It may be
convenient (as has been done in the text of this chapter) to use a
simple transliteration scheme for this; such a scheme should however be
properly documented in the header. </p>
<p>In the simplest case, nothing is given but the orthography:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth>doom-laden</orth>
</form>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Often, however, pronunciation is given.<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">soucoupe</hi> [sukup] … <ref target="#DIC-DNT">DNT</ref></q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="fr">
<form>
<orth>soucoupe</orth>
<pron>sukup</pron>
</form>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons including ease of processing, it may be desired to split
into separate elements information which is collapsed into a single element in the
source text; orthography and hyphenation may for example be transcribed as separate
elements, although given together in the source text. For a discussion of the issues
involved, and of methods for retaining both the presentation form and the
interpreted form, see section <ptr target="#DIMV"/>. </p>
<p>This example splits orthography and hyphenation, and adds syllabification because it
differs from hyphenation:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">ar.ea</hi> … <ref target="#DIC-W7">W7</ref></q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

   <stress>,....'..</stress>
</form>
]]>
</egXML>
-->
</p>
<p>Multiple orthographic forms may be given, e.g. to illustrate a word's inflectional
pattern:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">brag</hi> … vb. brags, bragging, bragged … <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref></q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth>brag</orth>
</form>
<gramGrp>
<pos>vb</pos>
</gramGrp>
<form type="inflected">
<orth>brags</orth>
<orth>bragging</orth>
<orth>bragged</orth>
</form>
</egXML> Or the inflectional pattern may be indicated by reference to a table of
paradigms, as here:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">horrifier</hi>
<code lang="ipa">[ORifje]</code> (7) vt … [C/R] </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="fr">
<form>
<orth>horrifier</orth>
<pron>ORifje</pron>
<gramGrp>
<iType type="vbtable">7</iType>
<!-- ... -->
</gramGrp>
</form>
<!-- ... -->
</egXML>
</p>
<!-- 
<p>As noted, <gi>iType</gi> etc. are synonymous with appropriately typed instances of
the general <gi>gram</gi> element; the last example might equally be tagged
thus:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth>horrifier</orth>
<pron>ORifje</pron>
<gram type="iType / vbtable">7</gram>
</form>
</egXML>
</p>
-->
<p>Explanatory labels may be attached to alternate forms:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">MTBF</hi>
<hi rend="it"> abbrev. for</hi> mean time between failures. <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref></q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry>
<form type="abbrev">
<orth>MTBF</orth>
</form>
<form type="full">
<lbl>abbrev. for</lbl>
<orth>mean time between failures</orth>
</form>
</entry>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>When multiple orthographic forms are given, a pronunciation may be associated with
all of them, as here:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">biryani</hi> or <hi rend="bold">biriani</hi>
<code lang="ipa">(%bIrI"A:nI) </code> … <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref></q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth>biryani</orth>
<orth>biriani</orth>
<pron>%bIrI"A:nI</pron>
</form>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>In other cases, different pronunciations are provided for different orthographic
forms; here, the <gi>form</gi> element is repeated to associate the first
orthographic form explicitly with the first pronunciation, and the second
orthographic form with the second pronunciation:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">mackle</hi>
<code lang="ipa">("mak^@l) </code> or macule <code lang="ipa">("makju:l) </code> … <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref> </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth>mackle</orth>
<pron>"makəl</pron>
</form>
<form>
<orth>macule</orth>
<pron>"makju:l</pron>
</form>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Recursive nesting of the <gi>form</gi> element can preserve relations among elements
that are implicit in the text. For example, in the CED entry for <q>hospitaller</q>,
it is clear that <q>U.S.</q> is associated only with <q>hospitaler</q>, but that the
pronunciation applies to both forms. The following encoding preserves these
relations:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">hospitaller</hi> or U.S. hospitaler <code lang="ipa">("hQspIt@l@) </code> … <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref> </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<head>Grammatical Information</head>
<p>The <gi>gramGrp</gi> element groups grammatical information, such as part of speech,
subcategorization information (e.g., syntactic patterns for verbs, count/mass
distinctions for nouns), etc. It can contain any of the morphological elements defined
in section <ptr target="#DITPFO"/> for <gi>form</gi>.
Elements conveying morphological information bear different
interpretations within <gi>gramGrp</gi> and <gi>form</gi> groups, the difference
being that in the <gi>form</gi> group, the morphological information specified
pertains to the specific alternate form in question, while within <gi>gramGrp</gi>
it applies to the headword form. For example, in the entry <q>
<hi rend="bold">pinna</hi> ('pIn@) n., pl. -nae (-ni:) or -nas</q> <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref>, the
word defined can be either singular or plural; the <q>pl.</q> specification applies
only to the inflected forms provided. Compare this with <q>pants (paents) pl.
n.</q>, where <q>pl.</q> applies to the headword itself. </p>
<p>As noted above in section <ptr target="#DITPFO"/>, the elements for morphological
information are simply shorthand for the general purpose <gi>gram</gi> element.
Consider this entry for the French word <mentioned>médire</mentioned>: <!-- no such word, unless you add the accent! (LB -->

<head>Sense Information</head>
<p>Dictionaries may describe the meanings of words in a wide variety of different ways —
by means of synonyms, paraphrases, translations into other languages, formal
definitions in various highly stylized forms, etc. No attempt is made here to
distinguish all the different forms which sense information may take;
all of them may
be tagged using the <gi>def</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#DITPDE"/>. </p>
<p>As a special case it is frequently desirable to distinguish
the provision of translation equivalents in other languages from other
forms of sense information; the use of <tag>cit
type="translation"</tag> (which groups a translation equivalent with
related information such as its grammatical description) 
for this purpose is described
in section <ptr target="#DITPTR"/>. </p>
<!--<p>Whether sense information in multilingual dictionaries is consistently tagged using
<gi>tr</gi> or <gi>def</gi> is a matter of the encoder's choice; no blanket
recommendation is made here. </p>-->
<div type="div4" xml:id="DITPDE">
<head>Definitions</head>
<p>Dictionary definitions are those pieces of prose in a dictionary entry that
describe the meaning of some lexical item. Most often, definitions describe the
headword of the entry; in some cases, they describe translated texts, examples,
etc.; see <tag>cit type="translation"</tag>, section <ptr target="#DITPTR"/>, and
<tag>cit type="example"</tag>, section <ptr target="#DITPEG"/>. The
<gi>def</gi> element directly contains the text of the definition; unlike
<gi>form</gi> and <gi>gramGrp</gi>, it does not serve solely to
group a set of smaller elements. The close analysis of definition text, such as
the tagging of hypernyms, typical objects, etc., is not covered by these
Guidelines. </p>
<p>Definitions may occur directly within an entry; when multiple
definitions are given, they are typically identified as belonging to
distinct senses, as here:<q rend="display"> <hi rend="bold">demigod</hi> (…) n. 1.a. a being who is part mortal, part
god. b. a lesser deity. 2. a godlike person. <ref target="#DIC-CP">CP</ref> </q>

<head>Translation Equivalents</head>
<p>Multilingual dictionaries contain information about translations of a given word
in some source language for one or more target languages. Minimally, the
dictionary provides the corresponding translation in the target language; other
material, such as morphological information (gender, case), various kinds of
usage restrictions, etc., may also be given. If translation equivalents are to
be distinguished from other kinds of sense information, they may be encoded
using <tag>cit type="translation"</tag>. The global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute
should be used to specify the target language. </p>
<p>As in monolingual dictionaries, the <gi>sense</gi> element is used in
multilingual dictionaries to group information (forms, grammatical information,
usage, translation(s), etc.) about a given sense of a word where necessary.
Information about the individual translation equivalents within a sense is
grouped using <tag>cit type="translation"</tag>. This information may include the
translation text (tagged <gi>q</gi> or <gi>quote</gi>), morphological
information (<gi>gen</gi>, <gi>case</gi>, etc.), usage notes (<gi>usg</gi>),
translation labels (<gi>lbl</gi>), and definitions (<gi>def</gi>).When
bibliographic data is provided, the <gi>quote</gi> element should be used.<specList>
<specDesc key="cit"/>

<head>Etymological Information</head>
<p>The element <gi>etym</gi> marks a block of etymological information. Etymologies may
contain highly structured lists of words in an order indicating their descent from
each other, but often also include related words and forms outside the direct line
of descent, for comparison. Not infrequently, etymologies include commentary of
various sorts, and can grow into short (or long!) essays with prose-like structure.
This variation in structure makes it impracticable to define tags which capture the
entire intellectual structure of the etymology or record the precise interrelation
of all the words mentioned. It is, however, feasible to mark some of the more
obvious phrase-level elements frequently found in etymologies, using tags defined in
the core module or elsewhere in this chapter. Of particular relevance for the
markup of etymologies are:<specList>
<specDesc key="etym"/>
<specDesc key="lang"/>
<specDesc key="date"/>
<specDesc key="mentioned"/>
<specDesc key="gloss"/>
<specDesc key="pron"/>
<specDesc key="usg"/>
<specDesc key="lbl"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>As in other prose, individual word forms mentioned in an etymological description are
tagged with <gi>mentioned</gi> elements. Pronunciations, usage labels, and glosses
can be tagged using the <gi>pron</gi>, <gi>usg</gi>, and <gi>gloss</gi> elements
defined elsewhere in these Guidelines. In addition, the <gi>lang</gi> element may be
used to identify a particular language name where it appears, in addition to using
the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute of the <gi>mentioned</gi> element. </p>

<head>Usage Information and Other Labels</head>

<p>Most dictionaries provide restrictive labels and phrases indicating
the usage of given words or particular senses. Other phrases, not
necessarily related to usage, may also be attached to forms, translations,
cross-references, and examples.  The following elements are provided
to mark up such  labels:<specList>
<specDesc key="usg"/>
<specDesc key="lbl"/>
</specList> As indicated in the following section (<ptr target="#DITPXR"/>), the
<gi>lbl</gi> element may be used for any kind of signicative phrase
or label within the text. The <gi>usg</gi> element is a specialization
of this to mark usage labels in particuar. Usage labels typically
indicate <list type="simple">
<item>temporal use (archaic, obsolete, etc.)</item>
<item>register (slang, formal, taboo, ironic, facetious, etc.)</item>
<item>style (literal, figurative, etc.)</item>
<item>connotative effect (e.g. derogatory, offensive)</item>
<item>subject field (Astronomy, Philosophy, etc.)</item>
<item>national or regional use (Australian, U.S., Midland dialect,
etc.)</item>
</list> Many dictionaries provide an explanation and/or a list of such usage
labels in a preface or appendix. The type of the usage information may be
indicated in the <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>usg</gi> element. Some
typical values are:<list type="gloss">
<label>
<val>geo</val>
</label>
<item>geographic area</item>

</label>
<item>language for foreign words, spellings pronunciations, etc.</item>
<label>
<val>gram</val>
</label>
<item>grammatical usage</item>
</list> In addition to this kind of information, multilingual dictionaries often
provide <soCalled>semantic cues</soCalled> to help the user determine the right
sense of a word in the source language (and hence the correct translation).
These include synonyms, concept subdivisions, typical subjects and objects,
typical verb complements, etc. These labels may also be marked with the
<gi>usg</gi> element; sample values for the <att>type</att> attribute in these
cases include:<list type="gloss">

<head>Cross-References to Other Entries</head>
<p>Dictionary entries frequently refer to information in other entries, often using
extremely dense notations to convey the headword of the entry to be sought, the
particular part of the entry being referred to, and the nature of the
information to be sought there (synonyms, antonyms, usage notes, etymology, an
illustration, etc.)</p>
<p>Cross-references may be tagged in dictionaries using the <gi>ref</gi> and
<gi>ptr</gi> elements defined in the core module (section <ptr target="#COXR"/>). In addition, the <gi>xr</gi> element may be used to group all the
information relating to a cross-reference. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="xr"/>
<specDesc key="ref"/>
<specDesc key="ptr"/>
<specDesc key="lbl"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>As in other types of text, the actual pointing element (e.g. <gi>ref</gi> or
<gi>ptr</gi>) is used to tag the cross-reference target proper (in
dictionaries, usually the headword, possibly accompanied by a homograph number,
a sense number, or other further restriction specifiying what portion of the
target entry is being referred to).
The <gi>xr</gi> element
is used to group the target with any accompanying phrases or symbols used to
label the cross-reference; the cross-reference label itself may be tagged as a
<gi>lbl</gi> or may remain untagged. Both of the following are thus
legitimate:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">glee</hi> … Compare <hi rend="bold">madrigal</hi> (sense 1)
<ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref> </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry>
<form>
<orth>glee</orth>
</form>
<xr>Compare <ptr target="#madrigal.1"/>
</xr>
</entry>
<entry xml:id="madrigal.1">
<form><!-- ... --></form>
</entry>
</egXML>
<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">hostellerie</hi> Syn. de hôtellerie (sens 1). <ref target="#DIC-DNT">DNT</ref> </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="fr">
<xr type="syn">
<lbl>Syn. de</lbl>
<ref>hôtellerie (sens 1)</ref>.</xr>
</egXML> In addition to using, or not using, <gi>lbl</gi> to mark the
cross-reference label, the two examples differ in another way. The former
assumes that the first sense of <mentioned>madrigal</mentioned> has the
identifier <val>madrigal.1</val>, and that the specific form of the reference in the
source volume can be reconstructed, if needed, from that information. The latter
does not require the first sense of <q>hôtellerie</q> to have an identifier, and
retains the print form of the cross-reference; by omitting the <att>target</att>
attribute of the <gi>ref</gi> element, however, the second example does assume
implicitly either that some software could usefully parse the phrase tagged as a
<gi>ref</gi> and find the location referred to, or else that such processing
will not be necessary. </p>
<p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the pointing element or on the <gi>xr</gi>
element may be used to indicate what kind of cross-reference is being made,
using any convenient typology. Since different dictionaries may label the same
kind of cross-reference in different ways, it may be useful to give normalized
indications in the<att>type</att> attribute, enabling the encoder to distinguish
irregular forms of cross-reference more reliably:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">rose</hi>2 … vb. the past tense of <hi rend="bold">rise</hi>. <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref> </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry n="2">
<form>
<orth>rose</orth>
</form>
<xr type="inflectedForm">

</xr>
</entry>
<!-- ... -->
<entry xml:id="rise">
<form>
<orth>rise</orth>
</form>
<!-- main entry for "rise" as verb -->
</entry>
</egXML> from cross-references for synonyms and the like:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">antagonist</hi> … syn see <hi rend="bold">adverse </hi>
<ref target="#DIC-W7">W7</ref> </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<xr type="synonym">
<lbl>syn see</lbl>
<ref target="#adverse">adverse</ref>
</xr>
<!-- ... -->
<entry xml:id="adverse">
<form>
<orth>adverse</orth>
</form>
<!-- list of synonyms  for "adverse"  -->
</entry>
</egXML>Strictly speaking, the reference above is not to the entry for
<mentioned>adverse</mentioned>, but to the list of synonyms found
within that entry. <!-- so why not point to that? --> 
<!--
Similarly,  the
target of the following reference is an illustration
accompanying another entry, not the whole entry:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">ax, axe</hi> … → see the illus at <hi rend="bold">tool
</hi> <ref target="#DIC-OALD">OALD</ref> </q> This entry refers to the illustration at the entry
for <mentioned>tool</mentioned>, not the entry itself. The <att>target</att>
attribute might give the identifier of the illustration itself, or of the
enclosing entry (in which case the <att>type</att> attribute might be used to
infer that the reference is actually to the illustration, not the entry as a
whole).<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<xr type="illustration">
<lbl>see the illus at</lbl>
<ptr target="#tool.illus"/>
</xr>

<entry xml:id="tool">
<form><orth>tool</orth></form>
...
<graphic xml:id="tool.illus" ref="tool-figure.png"/>
</entry>
</egXML>
-->
 In some cases, the cross-reference is to a particular subset of the
meanings of the entry in question:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">globe</hi> …V. <hi rend="bold">armillaire</hi> (sphère)
<ref target="#DIC-PR">PR</ref> </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="fr">
<xr>V. <ref target="#armillaire">armillaire</ref>
<lbl type="sense-restriction">sphère</lbl>
</xr>
</egXML>
</p>

<p>Cross-references occasionally occur in definition texts, example
texts, etc., or may be free-standing within an entry. These may
typically be encoded using <gi>ref</gi> or <gi>ptr</gi>, without an
enclosing <gi>xr</gi>. For example:
<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">entacher</hi> … <hi rend="it">Acte entaché de
nullité</hi>, contenant un vice de forme ou passé par un incapable*. <ref target="#DIC-DNT">DNT</ref>
</q> The asterisk signals a reference to the entry for
<mentioned>incapable</mentioned>.<egXML xml:lang="fr" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<def>contenant un vice de forme ou passé par un <ptr target="#incapable"/>.</def>
</egXML>
<!-- surely this should have been tagged as a <ref> not a 
<ptr> LB ? --> In
some cases, the form in the definition is inflected, and thus <gi>ref</gi> must
be used to indicate more exactly the intended target, as here:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">justifier</hi> …4. IMPRIM Donner a (une ligne) une longeur
convenable au moyen de blancs (2, sens 1, 3). <ref target="#DIC-DNT">DNT</ref> </q>

<head>Headword and Pronunciation References</head>
<p>Examples, definitions, etymologies, and occasionally other elements such as
cross-references, orthographic forms, etc., often contain a shortened or iconic reference to
the headword, rather than repeating the headword itself. The references may be to the
orthographic form or to the pronunciation, to the form given or to a variant of that
form. The following elements are used to encode such iconic references to a headword:<specList>
<specDesc key="oRef" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="pRef"/>
<specDesc key="oVar" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="pVar"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>These elements all inherit the following attributes from the class <ident type="class">att.pointing</ident>
which may optionally be used to resolve any
ambiguity about the headword form being referred to.<specList>
<specDesc key="att.pointing" atts="target"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Headword references come in a variety of formats:<list type="gloss">
<label>~ </label>
<item>indicates a reference to the full form of the headword</item>
<label>pref~ </label>
<item>gives a prefix to be affixed to the headword</item>
<label>~suf </label>
<item>gives a suffix to be affixed to the headword</item>
<label>A~ </label>
<item>gives the first letter in uppercase, indicating that the headword is
capitalized</item>
<label>pref~suf </label>
<item>gives a prefix and a suffix to be affixed to the headword</item>
<label>a. </label>
<item>gives the initial of the word followed by a full stop, to indicate reference
to the full form of the headword</item>
<label>A. </label>
<item>refers to a capitalized form of the headword </item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The <gi>oRef</gi> element should be used for iconic or shortened references to the
orthographic form(s) of the headword itself. It is an empty element and replaces, rather
than enclosing, the reference. Note that the reference to a headword is not necessarily
a simple string replacement. In the example <q>

<p>In many cases the reference is not to the orthographic form of the headword, but rather
to another form of the headword — usually to an inflected form. In these cases, the
element <gi>oVar</gi> should be used; this element takes as its content the string as it
appears in the text.<q rend="display">

</p>
<p>In addition, some dictionaries make reference to the pronunciation of the headword in the

the <gi>oRef</gi>, <gi>oVar</gi>, <gi>pRef</gi>, and <gi>pVar</gi> elements can appear
within any other element defined for dictionary entries. </p>
<p>Since existing printed dictionaries use different conventions for headword references
(swung dash, first letter abbreviated form, capitalization, or italicization of the word,

<head>Typographic and Lexical Information in Dictionary Data</head>
<p>Among the many possible views of dictionaries, it is useful to distinguish at least the
following three, which help to clarify some issues raised with particular urgency by
dictionaries, on account of the complexity of both their typography and their
information structure.<list type="simple">
<item>(a) the <term>typographic view</term> — the
two-dimensional printed page, including information about line and page breaks
and other features of layout </item>
<item>(b) the <term>editorial view</term> — the one-dimensional sequence of tokens
which can be seen as the input to the typesetting process; the wording and
punctuation of the text and the sequencing of items are visible in this view,
but specifics of the typographic realization are not </item>
<item>(c) the <term>lexical view</term> — this view includes the underlying
information represented in a dictionary, without concern for its exact textual
form </item>
</list>
</p>
<p>For example, a domain indication in a dictionary entry might be broken over a line and
therefore hyphenated (<q>naut-</q>
<q>ical</q>); the typographic view of the dictionary preserves this information. In a
purely editorial view, the particular form in which the domain name is given in the
particular dictionary (as <q>nautical</q>, rather than <q>naut.</q>, <q>Naut.</q>, etc.)
would be preserved, but the fact of the line break would not. Font shifts might
plausibly be included in either a strictly typographic or an editorial view. In the
lexical view, the only information preserved concerning domain would be some standard
symbol or string representing the nautical domain (e.g. <q>naut.</q>) regardless of the
form in which it appears in the printed dictionary. </p>
<p>In practice, publishers begin with the lexical view — i.e., lexical data as it might
appear in a database — and generate first the editorial view, which reflects editorial
choices for a particular dictionary (such as the use of the abbreviation <q>Naut.</q>
for <q>nautical</q>, the fonts in which different types of information are to be
rendered, etc.), and then the typographic view, which is tied to a specific printed
rendering. Computational linguists and philologists often begin with the typographic
view and analyse it to obtain the editorial and/or lexical views. Some users may
ultimately be concerned with retaining only the lexical view, or they may wish to
preserve the typographic or editorial views as a reference text, perhaps as a guard
against the loss or misinterpretation of information in the translation process. Some
researchers may wish to retain all three views, and study their interrelations, since
research questions may well span all three views. </p>
<p>In general, an electronic encoding of a text will allow the recovery of at least one view
of that text (the one which guided the encoding); if editorial and typographic practices
are consistently applied in the production of a printed dictionary, or if exceptions to
the rules are consistently recorded in the electronic encoding, then it is <emph>in
principle</emph> possible to recover the editorial view from an encoding of the
lexical view, and the typographic view from an encoding of the editorial view. In
practice, of course, the severe compression of information in dictionaries, the variety
of methods by which this compression is achieved, the complexity of formulating
completely explicit rules for editorial and typographic practice, and the relative
rarity of complete consistency in the application of such rules, all make the mechanical
transformation of information from one view into another something of a vexed question. </p>
<p>This section describes some principles which may be useful in capturing one or the other
of these views as consistently and completely as possible, and describes some methods of
attempting to capture more than one view in a single encoding. Only the editorial and
lexical views are explicitly treated here; for methods of recording the physical or
typographic details of a text, see chapter <ptr target="#PH"/>. Other approaches to
these problems, such as the use of repetitive encoding and links to show their
correspondences, or the use of feature structures to capture the information structure,
and of the <att>ana</att> and <att>inst</att> attributes to link feature structures to a
transcription of the editorial view of a dictionary, are not discussed here (for
feature structures, see chapter <ptr target="#FS"/>. For linkage of textual form and
underlying information, see chapter <ptr target="#AI"/>). </p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="DIMVTV">
<head>Editorial View</head>
<p>Common practice in encoding texts of all sorts relies on principles such as the
following, which can be used successfully to capture the editorial view when
encoding a dictionary:<list type="ordered">
<item>All characters of the source text should be retained, with the possible
exception of <term>rendition text</term> (for which see further below). </item>
<item>Characters appearing in the source text should typically be given as
character data content in the document, rather than as the value of an
attribute; again, rendition text may optionally be excepted from this rule. </item>
<item>Apart from the characters or graphics in the source text, nothing else
should appear as content in the document, although it may be given in
attribute values. </item>
<item>The material in the source text should appear in the encoding in the same
order. Complications of the character sequence by footnotes, marginal notes,
etc., text wrapping around illustrations, etc., may be dealt with by the
usual means (for notes, see section <ptr target="#CONO"/>).<note place="bottom">Complications of sequence caused by marginal or interlinear
insertions and deletions, which are frequent in manuscripts, or by
unconventional page layouts, as in concrete poetry, magazines with
imaginative graphic designers, and texts about the nature of typography
as a medium, typically do not occur in dictionaries, and so are not
discussed here.</note>
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>In a very conservative transcription of the editorial view of a text, <term>rendition
characters</term> (e.g. the commas, parentheses, etc., used in dictionary
entries to signal boundaries among parts of the entry) and <term>rendition
text</term> (for example, conjunctions joining alternate headwords, etc.) are
typically retained. Removing the tags from such a transcription will leave all and
only the characters of the source text, in their original sequence.<note place="bottom">This is a slight oversimplification. Even in conservative
transcriptions, it is common to omit page numbers, signatures of gatherings,
running titles and the like. The simple description above also elides, for the
sake of simplicity, the difficulties of assigning a meaning to the phrase
<q>original sequence</q> when it is applied to the printed characters of a
source text; the <q>original sequence</q> retained or recovered from a
conservative transcription of the editorial view is, of course, the one
established during the transcription by the encoder.</note>
</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the following entry:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">pinna</hi> ('pIn@) n., pl. -nae (-ni:) <hi rend="it">or</hi>
-nas. 1. any leaflet of a pinnate compound leaf. 2. <hi rend="it">Zoology</hi>.
a feather, wing, fin, or similarly shaped part. 3. another name for <hi rend="bold">auricle</hi> (sense 2). [C18: via New Latin from Latin: wing,
feather, fin] <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref></q> A conservative encoding of the editorial view of this
entry, which retains all rendition text, might resemble the following:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry>
<form>
<orth>pinna</orth>
<pron>("pIn@)</pron>

</entry>
<entry xml:id="auricle.2">
<form><!-- .... --></form>
</entry>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>A somewhat simplified encoding of the editorial view of this entry might exploit the
fact that rendition text is often systematically recoverable. For example,
parentheses consistently appear around pronunciation in this dictionary, and thus
are effectively implied by the start- and end-tags for <gi>pron</gi>.<note place="bottom">The omission of rendition text is particularly common in systems
for document production; it is considered good practice there, since automatic
generation of rendition text is more reliable and more consistent than
attempting to maintain it manually in the electronic text.</note> In such an
encoding, removing the tags should exactly reproduce the sequence of characters in
the source, minus rendition text. The original character sequence can be recovered
fully by replacing tags with any rendition text they imply. </p>
<p>Encoding in this way, the example given above might resemble the following. The
<gi>tagUsage</gi> element in the header would be used to record the following
patterns of rendition text:<list type="simple">
<item>parentheses appear around <gi>pron</gi> elements</item>
<item>commas appear before inflected forms</item>
<item>the word <q>or</q> appears before alternate forms</item>
<item>brackets appear around the etymology</item>
<item>full stops appear after <gi>pos</gi>, inflection information, and sense
numbers</item>
<item>senses are numbered in sequence unless otherwise specified using the
global <att>n</att> attribute</item>

<p>When rendition text is omitted, it is recommended that the means to regenerate it be
fully documented, using the <gi>tagUsage</gi> element of the TEI header. </p>
<p>If rendition text is used systematically in a dictionary, with only a few mistakes or
exceptions, the global attribute <att>rend</att> may be used on any tag to flag
exceptions to the normal treatment. The values of the <att>rend</att> attribute are
not prescribed, but it can be used with values such as <val>no-comma</val>,
<val>no-left-paren</val>, etc. Specific values can be documented using the
<gi>rendition</gi> element in the TEI header. </p>
<p>In the following (imaginary) example, no left parenthesis precedes the
pronunciation:<q rend="display">

<head>Lexical View</head>
<p>If the text to be interchanged retains only the lexical view of the text, there may
be no concern for the recoverability of the editorial (not to speak of the
typographic) view of the text. However, it is strongly recommended that the TEI
header be used to document fully the nature of all alterations to the original data,
such as normalization of domain names, expansion of inflected forms, etc. </p>
<p>In an encoding of the lexical view of a text, there are degrees of departure from the
original data: normalizing inconsistent forms like <q>nautical</q>, <q>naut</q>.,
<q>Naut.</q>, etc., to <q>nautical</q> is a relatively slight alteration;
expansion of <q>delay -ed -ing</q> to <q>delay, delayed, delaying</q> is a more
substantial departure. Still more severe is the rearranging of the order of
information in entries; for example:<list type="simple">
<item>reorganizing the order of elements in an entry to show their
relationship, as in<q rend="display"> <hi rend="bold">clem</hi> (klEm)
or clam vb. clems, clemming, clemmed or clams, clamming, clammed <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref></q> where in a strictly lexical view one
might wish to group <q>clem</q> and <q>clam</q> with their respective
inflected forms. </item>
<item>splitting an entry into two separate entries, as in <q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">celi.bacy</hi> /"selIb@sI/ n [U] state of living
unmarried, esp as a religious obligation. celi.bate /"selIb@t/ n [C]
unmarried person (esp a priest who has taken a vow not to marry).
<ref target="#DIC-OALD">OALD</ref></q> For some purposes, this entry might usefully be split into an
entry for <q>celibacy</q> and a separate entry for <q>celibate</q>. </item>
</list>
</p>
<p>An encoding which captures the lexical view of the example given in the previous
section might look something like the following. In this encoding:<list type="simple">
<item>abbreviated forms have been silently expanded</item>
<item>some forms have been moved to allow related forms to be grouped together</item>
<item>the part of speech information has been moved to allow all forms to be

characters would be those of the dominant view of the text. </p>
<p>The attribute class <ident type="class">att.lexicographic</ident> is used to
provide attributes for use in encoding multiple views of the same dictionary
entry. These attributes are available for use on all elements defined in this
chapter when the base module for dictionaries is selected. </p>
<p>When the editorial view is dominant, the following attributes may be used to
capture the lexical view:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.lexicographic" atts="norm split"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>When the lexical view is dominant, the following attributes may be used to record
the editorial view:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.lexicographic" atts="orig mergedIn"/>

</specList>
</p>
<p>One attribute is useful in either view:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.lexicographic" atts="opt"/>
</specList>
</p>
<p>For example, if the source text had the domain label <q>naut.</q>, it might be
encoded as follows. With the editorial view dominant:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<usg norm="nautical" type="dom">naut.</usg>
</egXML> The lexical view of the same label would transcribe the normalized form
as content of the <gi>usg</gi> element, the typographic form as an attribute
value:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<usg orig="naut." type="dom">nautical</usg>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>If the source text gives inflectional information for the verb
<mentioned>delay</mentioned> as <q>delay, -ed, -ing</q>, it might usefully be
expanded to <q>delayed, delayed, delaying</q>. An encoding of the editorial view
might take this form:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth>delay</orth>
<form type="inflected">
<orth norm="delayed" extent="part">-ed</orth>
<tns norm="pst,pstp"/>
</form>
<form type="inflected">
<orth norm="delaying" extent="part">-ing</orth>
<tns norm="prsp"/>
</form>
</form>
</egXML> Note the use of the <gi>tns</gi> tag with null content, to enable the
representation of implicit information even though it has no print realization. </p>
<p>The lexical view might be encoded thus:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth>delay</orth>
<form type="inflected">
<orth orig="-ed">delayed</orth>
<tns orig="">pst</tns>
<tns orig="">pstp</tns>
</form>
<form type="inflected">
<orth orig="-ing">delaying</orth>
<tns orig="">prsp</tns>
</form>
</form>
</egXML>
</p>

<!-- following section is problematic -->

<p>A particular problem may be posed by the common practice of presenting two
alternate forms of a word in a single string, by marking some parts of the word
as optional in some forms. The following entry is for a word which can be
spelled either <q>thyrostimuline</q> or <q>thyréostimuline</q>:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">thyr(é)ostimuline</hi> [tiR(e)ostimylin] …</q> With the
editorial view dominant, this entry might begin thus:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
 xml:lang="fr">
<form>
<orth split="thyrostimuline, thyréostimuline">thyr(é)ostimuline</orth>
<pron split="tiRostimylin, tiReostimylin">tiR(e)ostimylin</pron>
</form>
</egXML> 

With the lexical view dominant, however, two <gi>orth</gi> and
two <gi>pron</gi> elements would be encoded, in order to disentangle the two
forms; the <att>orig</att> attribute would be used to record the typographic
presentation of the information in the source.<egXML xml:lang="fr" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth xml:id="dic-o1" orig="thyr(é)ostimuline">thyrostimuline</orth>
<pron xml:id="dic-p1" orig="tiR(e)ostimylin">tiRostimylin</pron>
</form>
<form>
<orth mergedIn="#dic-o1">thyréostimuline</orth>
<pron mergedIn="#dic-p1">tiReostimylin</pron>
</form>
</egXML>

</p>

<p>This example might also be encoded using the <att>opt</att> attribute combined
with the attributes <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> defined in chapter <ptr
 target="#SA"/>.<egXML xml:lang="fr" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<form>
<orth next="#dict-o2" xml:id="dict-o1">thyr</orth>
<orth next="#dict-o3" prev="#dict-o1" xml:id="dict-o2" opt="true">é</orth>
<orth prev="#dict-o2" xml:id="dict-o3">ostimuline</orth>
<pron next="#dict-p2" xml:id="dict-p1">tiR</pron>
<pron next="#dict-p3" prev="#dict-p1" xml:id="dict-p2" opt="true">e</pron>
<pron prev="#dict-p2" xml:id="dict-p3">ostimylin</pron>
</form>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Note that this transcription preserves both the lexical and
editorial views in a single encoding. However, it has the disadvantage
that the strings corresponding to entire words do not appear in the
encoding uninterrupted, and therefore complex processing is required
to retrieve them from the encoded text. The use of the <att>opt</att>
attribute is recommended, however, when long spans of text are
involved, or when the optional part contains embedded tags. </p>

<p>For example, the following gives two definitions in one text:
<q>picture drawn with coloured chalk made into crayons</q>, and
<q>coloured chalk made into crayons</q>:
<q rend="display"> <hi rend="bold">pas.tel</hi> /"pastl US: pa"stel/ n
1 (picture drawn with) coloured chalk made into crayons. 2… <ref target="#DIC-OALD">OALD</ref></q> </p> <p>A simple encoding solution
would be to leave the definition text unanalysed, but this might be
felt inadequate since it does not show that there are two
definitions. A possible alternative encoding would be:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <sense n="1"> <def>coloured
chalk made into crayons</def> <def>picture drawn with coloured chalk
made into crayons</def> </sense> </egXML> </p> <p>This transcribes
some characters of the source text twice, however, which deviates from
the usual practice. The following encoding records both the editorial
and lexical views:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<sense n="1"> <def next="#d2" xml:id="d1" opt="true">picture drawn
with</def> <def prev="#d1" xml:id="d2">coloured chalk made into
crayons</def> </sense> </egXML> </p> <!-- example doesnt work because
cit isnt a member of att.lexicographic — and shouldnt be --> <!-- <p>A
more complex example is the following, in which the optional element
contains additional tags:<q rend="display"> <hi
rend="bold">canary</hi> ...(Geog) Canary Isles, Canaries (îles fpl)
Canaries fpl... <ref target="#DIC-CR">CR</ref></q> <egXML
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> <re type="cmpd"> <usg
type="dom">Geog</usg> <form> <orth>Canary Isles</orth>
<orth>Canaries</orth> </form> <cit type="translation" next="#DICT-t2"
xml:id="DICT-t1" opt="true"> <q>îles</q> <gen>f</gen>
<number>pl</number> </cit> <cit type="translation" prev="#DICT-t1"
xml:id="DICT-t2"> <q>Canaries</q> <gen>f</gen> <number>pl</number>
</cit> </re> </egXML> </p> -->

<head>Recording Original Locations of Transposed Elements</head>
<p>The attributes described in the previous section are useful only when the order
of material is the same in both the editorial and the lexical view. When the two
views impose different orders on the data, the standard linking mechanisms may be used to
show the original location of material transposed in an encoding of the lexical
view. </p>
<p>If the original is only slightly modified, the <gi>anchor</gi> element may be
used to mark the original location of the material, and the <att>location</att>
attribute may be used on the lexical encoding of that material to indicate its
original location(s). Like those in the preceding section, this attribute is
defined for the attribute class <ident type="class">att.lexicographic</ident>:<specList>
<specDesc key="att.lexicographic" atts="opt"/>

<head>Unstructured Entries</head>

<p>The content model for the <gi>entry</gi> element provides an entry
structure suitable for many average dictionaries, as well as many
regular entries in more exotic dictionaries.  However, the structure
of some dictionaries does not allow the restrictions imposed by the
content model for <gi>entry</gi>. To handle these cases, the
<gi>entryFree</gi> and <gi>dictScrap</gi> elements are provided to
support much wider variation in entry structure. The
<gi>dictScrap</gi> element offers less freedom, in that it can only
contain phrase level elements, but it can itself appear at any point
within a dictionary entry where any of the structural components of a
dictionary entry are permitted. As such, it acts as a container for
otherwise anomalous parts of an entry.</p>

<p>The <gi>entryFree</gi> element places no constraints at all upon
the entry: any element defined in this chapter, as well as all the
normal phrase-level and inter-level elements, can
appear anywhere within it. With the <gi>entryFree</gi> element, the
encoder is free to use any element anywhere, as well as to use or omit
grouping elements such as <gi>form</gi>, <gi>gramGrp</gi>, etc. </p>

<p>The <gi>entryFree</gi> element allows the encoding of entries which
violate the structure specified for the <gi>entry</gi> element. For
example, in the following entry from a dictionary already in
electronic form, it is necessary to include a <gi>pron</gi> element
within a <gi>def</gi>. This is not permitted in the content model for
<gi>entry</gi>, but it poses no problem in the <gi>entryFree</gi>
element. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">&lt;ent
h="demigod"&gt; &lt;hwd&gt;demi|god&lt;/hwd&gt; &lt;pr&gt; &lt;ph&gt;"demIgQd&lt;/ph&gt; &lt;/pr&gt; &lt;hps
ps="n"&gt; &lt;hsn&gt; &lt;def&gt;one who is partly divine and partly human&lt;/def&gt;
&lt;def&gt;(in Gk myth, etc) the son of a god and a mortal woman,
eg&lt;cf&gt;Hercules&lt;/cf&gt; &lt;pr&gt; &lt;ph&gt;"h3:kjUli:z&lt;/ph&gt; &lt;/pr&gt; &lt;/def&gt; &lt;/hsn&gt;
&lt;/hps&gt; &lt;/ent&gt; </egXML>(<ref target="#DIC-OALD">OALD</ref>)
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entryFree>
<form>

<hyph>demi|god</hyph>
<pron>"demIgQd</pron>

<mentioned>Hercules</mentioned></def>
<pron>"h3:kjUli:z</pron>
</entryFree>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The <gi>entryFree</gi> element also makes it possible to transcribe a dictionary using
only phrase-level (<soCalled>atomic</soCalled>) elements—that is, using no grouping
elements at all. This can be desirable if the encoder wants a completely
<soCalled>flat</soCalled> view, with no indication of or commitment to the association
of one element with another. The following encoding uses no grouping elements, and keeps
all rendition text:<q rend="display">
<hi rend="bold">biryani</hi> or <hi rend="bold">biriani</hi>
<code lang="ipa">(%bIrI"A:nI) </code> any of a variety of Indian dishes…[from
Urdu] <ref target="#DIC-CED">CED</ref> </q>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<def>any of a variety of Indian dishes …</def>
<etym>[from <lang>Urdu</lang>]</etym>
</entryFree>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Here is an alternative way of representing the same structure, this time using
<gi>dictScrap</gi>:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<entry>
<dictScrap>
<orth>biryani</orth> or <orth>biriani</orth>
