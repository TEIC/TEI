    <p>In this section we are going to walk you through what is probably you're first session editing an XML document. 
        We will assume you have installed oXygen XML editor. As explained in the previous section, you can edit TEI documents 
        in many different XML editors. oXygen however is currently a popular choice in the TEI community. Whatever editor 
        you use, it should be possible to do many of the things we will mention here. We encourage you to take the time 
        to get familiar with the editor. It will increase your confidence while working with XML. It will also save you lots of 
        time, if you know some of the shortcuts that your editor provides for actions that often recur.</p>
    <p>If you feel you are already fairly comfortable with XML editing, you can skim through this section and go to the next.</p>
    <list type="ordered">
        <item>To get started, go to <ref target="http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/GettingStarted/html/lm.html">
        http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/GettingStarted/html/lm.html</ref> and download 
            <ref target="http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/GettingStarted/samples/diaryfragment.zip">diaryfragment.zip</ref>. 
            Extract the files into some folder that you have access to. You should see there two files: diaryfragment.xml 
            and graves1938-10-10.jpg. The XML file integrates the examples that we used in section 
            <ptr target="#os"/>.</item>
        <item>Open the XML file in oXygen. If (on Windows) you associated the XML file type with oXygen, you can 
        do that by double-clicking the XML file. Otherwise, start oXygen and open the file from the program.</item>
    </list>
    <p>What you see now may look like this:</p>

     </figure>
    <p>We will now walk through a number of this editor's features. Many of those you will also find in other editors.</p>
    <div xml:id="lmview">
    <head>Multiple views and modes</head>
    <p>Next to the main document view, you notice a number of smaller windows. They give information either about 
    the text itself or the things that are allowed at that current location in the text. They can be opened (in oXygen)
    using the Project Menu, option Views. In the image above, we notice among others an outline view. The outline view
    shows an indented view of the hierarchical structure of the XML document, including elements, identifying attributes and text.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Outline view</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-view-outline.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>Another view is the attributes view. The attributes view shows the attributes available on the current element and their values.
    It can also be used to edit the attributes' values.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Attribute view</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-view-attrs.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The elements view shows the elements that the current element can contain.
    Double-clicking an element inserts it into the document at the cursor location.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Elements view</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-view-elements.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>While these views can offer valuable information, of course they also use space that you could use for the edited file.</p>
    <p>The edited text as it is displayed in the images we saw up to now includes the text and the XML tags. It is oXygen's standard 
    display, and it is called the text mode. There are also two other editing modes, called grid mode (useful for editing spreadsheet-like
    XML document, but not for TEI documents) and author mode. In author mode, the XML tags are hidden. The buttons that switch between the
    modes are located in he left bottom corner of the text view</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Mode switch buttons</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-modebutton.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>Author mode, as we see below, formats the text in an author-friendly view, that helps the author focus on the document text rather 
    than on XML tagging. We notice that some elements have received an appropriate display: <gi>del</gi> elements are shown in red 
    and crossed out, <gi>add</gi> elements are shown in green.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Document in author mode</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-authormode.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The user can choose the amount of XML tagging that is made visible in author mode. Buttons on the toolbar can be used to switch 
    between several options. More information, including a video demonstration,
    is available on the <ref target="http://www.oxygenxml.com/tei_editor.html">oXygen site</ref>. </p>

    <div xml:id="lmschem">
    <head>The schema</head>
    <p>In the previous section we envountered a number of extra views next to the edited document, including overviews of the 
    attributes and elements that are available in a specific location. The information in these views does not come from the 
    document, but from the <term target="getstartgloss.xml#sch">schema</term> that describes the document. How does the editor know which schema to apply? After all, the 
    XML file does not refer to this schema. </p>
    <p>The answer is that the editor uses certain rules to guess what type of file it is dealing with. In this case, it decides 
    this is a TEI document, based on the TEI <term target="getstartgloss.xml#ns">namespace</term> http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Choosing the TEI namespace </head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-namespace.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>We could have explicitly chosen to use a certain schema. Unfortunately, for the type of schema that we use in this 
    document, <term target="getstartgloss.xml#sch">Relax NG schema's</term>,
    there is no standard way to set the connection between document and schema. oXygen uses an <ref target="#glxmlpi">XML 
    processing instruction</ref>. The next figure shows how to create such an instruction, and the resulting but of XML code.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Associating a document with a schema</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-schema.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The schema will be used for three purposes: to present allowed elements, attributes, and values to the user when he/she is 
    editing the file, to validate the contents of the file, and to provide information about the definition of the element or attribute that 
    the mouse hovers over. This last application of the schema you can verify immediately by placing the mouse over any eleent or attribute.
    The next figure shows an example.</p>      
    <figure>
    <head>Placing the mouse over the n attribute shows the attribute's definition, taken from the schema.</head>

    </figure>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="lmmod">
    <head>Modifying the document</head>
    <p>Let us modify the document, e.g. by adding another paragraph after the last one in the diary entry. Place the mouse after the closing 
    <![CDATA[</p>]]>, hit Enter and type &lt;. Based on the schema, the editor knows what elements are allowed in this context, and offers a list of 
    these elements, that you can use the keyboard or the mouse to select an element from. Alongside the selected elemet the system shows its 
    definition.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>An element selection list appears after the user types the opening bracket ("&lt;").</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-elt-select.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>We select the <gi>p</gi> (paragraph) element. Note that the system adds the closing tag for us. Let us type some text and highlight a word.
    That gives us an opportunity to show another way of adding an element: selecting a piece of text and choosing the "Surround with tags" option, 
    either from the context menu (option Refactoring) or using the Ctrl-E keyboard shortcut.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Surrounding a selection with an element.</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-elt-surround.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The system can also prompt the user with the allowed attributes. Once we have created the hi element to highlight a word, we can 
    add the rend attribute to say how it should be highlighted. Once we type the first space character in the opening tag <![CDATA[<hi>]]> 
    the system assumes we want to add an attribute and shows them as follows:</p>
    <figure>
    <head>An attribute selection list appears after typing a space in an opening tag.</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-attr-select.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>If the schema would have defined a fixed list of allowed values for the rend attribute, we could select one of these values in the same way.</p>
    </div>
    <div  xml:id="lmvalid">
    <head>Validation</head>
    <p>There are several levels of checking XML documents for correctness. At a syntactical level, XML documents are checked for 
    well-formedness. This is a check for the properties described in <ptr target="#tbxml.nutshell"/>. 
    At a semantic level, XML documents can be checked for validity with respect to a schema. The process of 'validation' 
    is usually understood to do both types of checks.</p>
    <p>Just like modern word processors do spell checking on the fly, modern XML editors do validation 'as you type'. The syntax checker finds 
    a problem, e.g., immediately when we remove the closing tag (<![CDATA[</p>]]>) of the paragraph we added in our sample document.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Syntax error</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-error-termination.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>Notice the removed <![CDATA[</p>]]>, the red curly line indicating that something is wrong (the <gi>div</gi> closes before the 
    <gi>p</gi> inside it is closed), the indicator that there is an error in the right margin, and the error message below. Now let 
    us make a semantic error and create a <gi>ptest</gi> element after our paragraph. The <gi>ptest</gi> element does not exist, so we 
    will have to type that manually. Again, the system will tell us we have made a mistake: using the red curly line, the indicator in 
    the margin and the error message.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Validation error</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-error-elt.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The user can also explicitly request validation. This may be useful e.g. when nothing has changed in the document, but the schema has 
    been modified. The user can then ask to refresh the schema <term target="getstartgloss.xml#cache">cache</term> before validation is done.</p>
    <figure>
    <head>Activate validation manually</head>
    <graphic url="images/lm-editor-validate.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>After validation, the right margin will show the location of errors in the document. Clicking the red bar will bring up the corresponding error.
    The red square at the rop indicates the document contains errors. </p>

    </div>
    <div xml:id="lmmore">
    <head>And more...</head>
    <p>Of course the editor contains a lot more functionality that can help make life easier for the XML encoder. We cannot go into more detail here,
    but again we urge the reader to explore and take advantage of what is there. </p>
