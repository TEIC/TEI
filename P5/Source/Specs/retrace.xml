   <remarks>
      <p>Multiple retraces are indicated by nesting one
      <gi>retrace</gi> within another. In principle, a retrace
      differs from a substitution in that second and subsequent
      rewrites do not materially alter the content of an
      element. Where minor changes have been made during the retracing action
      however these may be marked up using <gi>del</gi>, <gi>add</gi>,
      etc. with an appropriate value for the <att>change</att>
      attribute.</p>
<!-- need an example for the latter case -->
