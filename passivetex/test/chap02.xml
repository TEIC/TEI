<title>II</title>

<paragraph>&ldquo;One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my
steamboat, I heard voices approaching &mdash; and there were the
nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank. I laid my head on my
arm again, and had nearly lost myself in a doze, when somebody said in
my ear, as it were: &lsquo;I am as harmless as a little child, but I
don't like to be dictated to. Am I the manager &mdash; or am I not? I
was ordered to send him there. It's incredible.&rsquo;&hellip; I
became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside the
forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did not move; it did
not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. &lsquo;It is unpleasant,&rsquo;
grunted the uncle. &lsquo;He has asked the Administration to be sent
there,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;with the idea of showing what he
could do; and I was instructed accordingly.  Look at the influence
that man must have. Is it not frightful?&rsquo; They both agreed it
was frightful, then made several bizarre remarks: &lsquo;Make rain and
fine weather &mdash; one man &mdash; the Council &mdash; by the
nose&rsquo; &mdash; bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my
drowsiness, so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits about me
when the uncle said, &lsquo;The climate may do away with this
difficulty for you. Is he alone there?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
answered the manager; &lsquo;he sent his assistant down the river with
a note to me in these terms: &ldquo;Clear this poor devil out of the
country, and don't bother sending more of that sort. I had rather be
alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me.&rdquo; It
was more than a year ago. Can you imagine such impudence!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Anything since then?&rsquo; asked the other
hoarsely. &lsquo;Ivory,&rsquo; jerked the nephew; &lsquo;lots of it
&mdash; prime sort &mdash; lots &mdash; most annoying, from
him.&rsquo; &lsquo;And with that?&rsquo; questioned the heavy
rumble. &lsquo;Invoice,&rsquo; was the reply fired out, so to
speak. Then silence.  They had been talking about Kurtz.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly
at ease, remained still, having no inducement to change my
position. &lsquo;How did that ivory come all this way?&rsquo; growled
the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The other explained that it had
come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an English half-caste clerk
Kurtz had with him; that Kurtz had apparently intended to return
himself, the station being by that time bare of goods and stores, but
after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly decided to go back,
which he started to do alone in a small dugout with four paddlers,
leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the ivory. The
two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such a
thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I seemed
to see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the
dugout, four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back
suddenly on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home &mdash;
perhaps; setting his face towards the depths of the wilderness,
towards his empty and desolate station. I did not know the
motive. Perhaps he was just simply a fine fellow who stuck to his work
for its own sake.  His name, you understand, had not been pronounced
once. He was &lsquo;that man.&rsquo; The half caste, who, as far as I
could see, had conducted a difficult trip with great prudence and
pluck, was invariably alluded to as &lsquo;that scoundrel.&rsquo; The
&lsquo;scoundrel&rsquo; had reported that the &lsquo;man&rsquo; had
been very ill &mdash; had recovered imperfectly&hellip; The two below
me moved away then a few paces, and strolled back and forth at some
little distance. I heard: &lsquo;Military post &mdash; doctor &mdash;
two hundred miles &mdash; quite alone now &mdash; unavoidable delays
&mdash; nine months &mdash; no news &mdash; strange rumours.&rsquo;
They approached again, just as the manager was saying, &lsquo;No one,
as far as I know, unless a species of wandering trader &mdash; a
pestilential fellow, snapping ivory from the natives.&rsquo; Who was
it they were talking about now? I gathered in snatches that this was
some man supposed to be in Kurtz's district, and of whom the manager
did not approve. &lsquo;We will not be free from unfair competition
till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,&rsquo; he
said. &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; grunted the other; &lsquo;get him
hanged! Why not? Anything &mdash; anything can be done in this
country. That's what I say; nobody here, you understand, here, can
endanger your position.  And why? You stand the climate &mdash; you
outlast them all. The danger is in Europe; but there before I left I
took care to &mdash;&rsquo; They moved off and whispered, then their
voices rose again. &lsquo;The extraordinary series of delays is not my
fault. I did my best.&rsquo; The fat man sighed. &lsquo;Very
sad.&rsquo; &lsquo;And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk,&rsquo;
continued the other; &lsquo;he bothered me enough when he was
here. &ldquo;Each station should be like a beacon on the road towards
better things, a centre for trade of course, but also for humanizing,
improving, instructing.&rdquo; Conceive you &mdash; that ass! And he
wants to be manager! No, it's &mdash;&rsquo; Here he got choked by
excessive indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I was
surprised to see how near they were &mdash; right under me. I could
have spat upon their hats.  They were looking on the ground, absorbed
in thought. The manager was switching his leg with a slender twig: his
sagacious relative lifted his head.  &lsquo;You have been well since
you came out this time?&rsquo; he asked. The other gave a
start. &lsquo;Who? I? Oh! Like a charm &mdash; like a charm. But the
rest &mdash; oh, my goodness!  All sick. They die so quick, too, that
I haven't the time to send them out of the country &mdash; it's
incredible!&rsquo; &lsquo;H'm. Just so,&rsquo; grunted the
uncle. &lsquo;Ah! my boy, trust to this &mdash; I say, trust to
this.&rsquo; I saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a
gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the river &mdash;
seemed to beckon with a dishonouring flourish before the sunlit face
of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden
evil, to the profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling that
I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as
though I had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of
confidence. You know the foolish notions that come to one
sometimes. The high stillness confronted these two figures with its
ominous patience, waiting for the passing away of a fantastic
invasion.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;They swore aloud together &mdash; out of sheer
fright, I believe &mdash; then pretending not to know anything of my
existence, turned back to the station. The sun was low; and leaning
forward side by side, they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their
two ridiculous shadows of unequal length, that trailed behind them
slowly over the tall grass without bending a single blade.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;In a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the
patient wilderness, that dosed upon it as the sea closes over a
diver. Long afterwards the news came that all the donkeys were dead. I
know nothing as to the fate of the less valuable animals. They, no
doubt, like the rest of us, found what they deserved. I did not
inquire. I was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting Kurtz
very soon. When I say very soon I mean it comparatively. It was just
two months from the day we left the creek when we came to the bank
below Kurtz's station.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;Going up that river was like travelling back to the
earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth
and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an
impenetrable forest.  The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There
was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long stretches of the
waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of over-shadowed
distances. On silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned
themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed through a mob of
wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you would in a
desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the
channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from
everything you had known once &mdash; somewhere &mdash; far away
&mdash; in another existence perhaps. There were moments when one's
past came back to one, as it will sometimes when you have not a moment
to spare to yourself; but it came in the shape of an unrestful and
noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities
of this strange world of plants, and water, and silence.  And this
stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace. It was the
stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable
intention. It looked at you with a vengeful aspect. I got used to it
afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no time. I had to keep
guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by inspiration, the
signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I was learning to
clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I shaved by a
fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out
of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to keep a
lookout for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for
next day's steaming. When you have to attend to things of that sort,
to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality &mdash; the reality,
I tell you &mdash; fades. The inner truth is hidden &mdash; luckily,
luckily. But I felt it all the same; I felt often its mysterious
stillness watching me at my monkey tricks, just as it watches you
fellows performing on your respective tight-ropes for &mdash; what is
it?  half-a-crown a tumble &mdash;&rdquo;</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;Try to be civil, Marlow,&rdquo; growled a voice, and
I knew there was at least one listener awake besides
myself.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which
makes up the rest of the price. And indeed what does the price matter,
if the trick be well done? You do your tricks very well. And I didn't
do badly either, since I managed not to sink that steamboat on my
first trip. It's a wonder to me yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to
drive a van over a bad road. I sweated and shivered over that business
considerably, I can tell you. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the
bottom of the thing that's supposed to float all the time under his
care is the unpardonable sin. No one may know of it, but you never
forget the thump &mdash; eh? A blow on the very heart. You remember
it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and think of it &mdash;
years after &mdash; and go hot and cold all over. I don't pretend to
say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to
wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing. We
had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine fellows
&mdash; cannibals &mdash; in their place. They were men one could work
with, and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each
other before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat
which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my
nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and
three or four pilgrims with their staves &mdash; all
complete. Sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank, clinging
to the skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing out of a
tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and surprise and
welcome, seemed very strange &mdash; had the appearance of being held
there captive by a spell. The word ivory would ring in the air for a
while &mdash; and on we went again into the silence, along empty
reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of our winding
way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the
stern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense,
running up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the
stream, crept the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle
crawling on the floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small,
very lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing, that
feeling. After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled on
&mdash; which was just what you wanted it to do. Where the pilgrims
imagined it crawled to I don't know. To some place where they expected
to get something. I bet! For me it crawled towards Kurtz &mdash;
exclusively; but when the steam-pipes started leaking we crawled very
slow.  The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the
forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our
return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. It
was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the
curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly,
as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till the first break of
day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could not tell. The
dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness; the
wood-cutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig
would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an
earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied
ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed
inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of
excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there
would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of
yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet
stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy
and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of
a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing
us, praying to us, welcoming us &mdash; who could tell? We were cut
off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like
phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before
an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not understand
because we were too far and could not remember because we were
travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone,
leaving hardly a sign &mdash; and no memories.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to
look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there &mdash;
there you could look at a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly,
and the men were &mdash; No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know,
that was the worst of it &mdash; this suspicion of their not being
inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and
spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the
thought of their humanity &mdash; like yours &mdash; the thought of
your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly.  Yes,
it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to
yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response
to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there
being a meaning in it which you &mdash; you so remote from the night
of first ages &mdash; could comprehend. And why not?  The mind of man
is capable of anything &mdash; because everything is in it, all the
past as well as all the future.  What was there after all? Joy, fear,
sorrow, devotion, valour, rage &mdash; who can tell? &mdash; but truth
&mdash; truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and
shudder &mdash; the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he
must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet
that truth with his own true stuff &mdash; with his own inborn
strength. Principles won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags
&mdash; rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want
a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish row &mdash; is
there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice, too, and for
good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a
fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe.
Who's that grunting? You wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a
dance? Well, no &mdash; I didn't. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine
sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with
white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on
those leaky steampipes &mdash; I tell you. I had to watch the
steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by
hook or by crook. There was surface-truth enough in these things to
save a wiser man. And between whiles I had to look after the savage
who was fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a
vertical boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at
him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a
feather hat, walking on his hindlegs. A few months of training had
done for that really fine chap. He squinted at the steam-gauge and at
the water-guage with an evident effort of intrepidity &mdash; and he
had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved
into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his
cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet
on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to strange
witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because he had
been instructed; and what he knew was this &mdash; that should the
water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the
boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a
terrible vengeance. So he sweated and watched the glass fearfully
(with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece
of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his lower
lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise
was left behind, the interminable miles of silence &mdash; and we
crept on, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was
treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky
devil in it, and thus neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer
into our creepy thoughts.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came
upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole, with the
unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of some sort flying
from it, and a neatly stacked woodpile. This was unexpected. We came
to the bank, and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board
with some faded pencil-writing on it. When deciphered it said:
&lsquo;Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach cautiously.&rsquo; There was a
signature, but it was illegible &mdash; not Kurtz &mdash; a much
longer word. &lsquo;Hurry up.&rsquo; Where? Up the river?
&lsquo;Approach cautiously.&rsquo; We had not done so. But the warning
could not have been meant for the place where it could be only found
after approach. Something was wrong above. But what &mdash; and how
much? That was the question. We commented adversely upon the
imbecility of that telegraphic style. The bush around said nothing,
and would not let us look very far either. A torn curtain of red twill
hung in the doorway of the hut, and flapped sadly in our faces. The
dwelling was dismantled; but we could see a white man had lived there
not very long ago. There remained a rude table &mdash; a plank on two
posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner, and by the door I
picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the pages had been
thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the back had
been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which looked
clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, An Inquiry
into some Points of Seamanship, by a man Towser, Towson &mdash; some
such name &mdash; Master in his Majesty's Navy. The matter looked
dreary reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables
of figures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing
antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should
dissolve in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly
into the breaking strain of ships&rsquo; chains and tackle, and other
such matters. Not a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you
could see there a singleness of intention, an honest concern for the
right way of going to work, which made these humble pages, thought out
so many years ago, luminous with another than a professional
light. The simple old sailor, with his talk of chains and purchases,
made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of
having come upon something unmistakably real. Such a book being there
was wonderful enough but still more astounding were the notes
pencilled in the margin, and plainly referring to the text.  I
couldn't believe my eyes! They were in cipher! Yes, it looked like
cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a book of that description into
this nowhere and studying it &mdash; and making notes &mdash; in
cipher at that! It was an extravagant mystery.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying
noise, and when I lifted my eyes I saw the woodpile was gone, and the
manager, aided by all the pilgrims, was shouting at me from the
riverside. I slipped the book into my pocket. I assure you to leave
off reading was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old
and solid friendship.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I started the lame engine ahead. &lsquo;It must be
this miserable trader &mdash; this intruder,&rsquo; exclaimed the
manager, looking back malevolently at the place we had left. &lsquo;He
must be English,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;It will not save him from
getting into trouble if he is not careful,&rsquo; muttered the manager
darkly. I observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from
trouble in this world.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;The current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed
at her last gasp, the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught
myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of the boat, for in sober
truth I expected the wretched thing to give up every moment. It was
like watching the last flickers of a life. But still we crawled.
Sometimes I would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our
progress towards Kurtz by, but I lost it invariably before we got
abreast. To keep the eyes so long on one thing was too much for human
patience.  The manager displayed a beautiful resignation. I fretted
and fumed and took to arguing with myself whether or no I would talk
openly with Kurtz; but before I could come to any conclusion it
occurred to me that my speech or my silence, indeed any action of
mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter what any one knew
or ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One gets sometimes
such a flash of insight. The essentials of this affair lay deep under
the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of
meddling.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;Towards the evening of the second day we judged
ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz's station. I wanted to push on;
but the manager looked grave, and told me the navigation up there was
so dangerous that it would be advisable, the sun being very low
already, to wait where we were till next morning.  Moreover, he
pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be
followed, we must approach in daylight &mdash; not at dusk or in the
dark. This was sensible enough. Eight miles meant nearly three hours'
steaming for us, and I could also see suspicious ripples at the upper
end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was annoyed beyond expression at the
delay, and most unreasonably, too, since one night more could not
matter much after so many months. As we had plenty of wood, and
caution was the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream. The
reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a railway
cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set.
The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the
banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every
living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone,
even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep
&mdash; it seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest
sound of any kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to
suspect yourself of being deaf&mdash; then the night came suddenly,
and struck you blind as well. About three in the morning some large
fish leaped, and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been
fired. When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy,
and more blinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it was
just there, standing all round you like something solid. At eight or
nine, perhaps, it lifted as a shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the
towering multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the
blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it &mdash; all perfectly
still &mdash; and then the white shutter came down again, smoothly, as
if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the chain, which we had begun
to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it stopped running with a
muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of infinite desolation,
soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A complaining clamour,
modulated in savage discords, filled our ears. The sheer
unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I don't know how
it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had
screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this
tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried
outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped
short, leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and
obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive
silence. &lsquo;Good God! What is the meaning &mdash;&rsquo; stammered
at my elbow one of the pilgrims &mdash; a little fat man, with sandy
hair and red whiskers, who wore sidespring boots, and pink pyjamas
tucked into his socks. Two others remained open-mouthed a whole
minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush out incontinently
and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at
&lsquo;ready&rsquo; in their hands. What we could see was just the
steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the
point of dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet
broad, around her &mdash; and that was all. The rest of the world was
nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere.
Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow
behind.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled
in short, so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat
at once if necessary. &lsquo;Will they attack?&rsquo; whispered an
awed voice. &lsquo;We will be all butchered in this fog,&rsquo;
murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the hands
trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious to see
the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows
of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the river as
we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away.  The
whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of
being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others had an
alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were
essentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they
hauled at the chain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which
seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a
young, broad-chested black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed
cloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily
ringlets, stood near me. &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; I said, just for good
fellowship's sake. &lsquo;Catch 'im,&rsquo; he snapped, with a
bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth &mdash;
&lsquo;catch 'im. Give 'im to us. &lsquo;To you, eh?&rsquo; I asked;
&lsquo;what would you do with them?&rsquo; &lsquo;Eat 'im!&rsquo; he
said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail, looked out into the
fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude. I would no doubt
have been properly horrified, had it not occurred to me that he and
his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been growing
increasingly hungry for at least this month past. They had been
engaged for six months (I don't think a single one of them had any
clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They
still belonged to the beginnings of time &mdash; had no inherited
experience to teach them as it were), and of course, as long as there
was a piece of paper written over in accordance with some farcical law
or other made down the river, it didn't enter anybody's head to
trouble how they would live. Certainly they had brought with them some
rotten hippo-meat, which couldn't have lasted very long, anyway, even
if the pilgrims hadn't, in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown
a considerable quantity of it overboard. It looked like a high-handed
proceeding; but it was really a case of legitimate self-defence. You
can't breathe dead hippo waking, sleeping, and eating, and at the same
time keep your precarious grip on existence.  Besides that, they had
given them every week three pieces of brass wire, each about nine
inches long; and the theory was they were to buy their provisions with
that currency in riverside villages. You can see how that
worked. There were either no villages, or the people were hostile, or
the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with an
occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn't want to stop the steamer for
some more or less recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire
itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with, I don't see what
good their extravagant salary could be to them. I must say it was paid
with a regularity worthy of a large and honourable trading
company. For the rest, the only thing to eat &mdash; though it didn't
look eatable in the least &mdash; I saw in their possession was a few
lumps of some stuff like half-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender
colour, they kept wrapped in leaves, and now and then swallowed a
piece of, but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the
thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance.  Why in the name of
all the gnawing devils of hunger they didn't go for us &mdash; they
were thirty to five &mdash; and have a good tuck-in for once, amazes
me now when I think of it. They were big powerful men, with not much
capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with strength, even
yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no
longer hard.  And I saw that something restraining, one of those human
secrets that baffle probability, had come into play there. I looked at
them with a swift quickening of interest &mdash; not because it
occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own
to you that just then I perceived &mdash; in a new light, as it were
&mdash; how unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I
positively hoped, that my aspect was not so &mdash; what shall I say?
&mdash; so &mdash; unappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity which
fitted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded all my days at that
time. Perhaps I had a little fever, too. One can't live with one's
finger everlastingly on one's pulse. I had often &lsquo;a little
fever,&rsquo; or a little touch of other things &mdash; the playful
paw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the
more serious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them
as you would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses,
motives, capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an
inexorable physical necessity. Restraint!  What possible restraint?
Was it superstition, disgust, patience, fear &mdash; or some kind of
primitive honour? No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear
it out, disgust simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to
superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are less
than chaff in a breeze. Don't you know the devilry of lingering
starvation, its exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its sombre
and brooding ferocity? Well, I do. It takes a man all his inborn
strength to fight hunger properly. It's really easier to face
bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of one's soul &mdash; than
this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these chaps, too,
had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I would just
as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the
corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me &mdash; the
fact dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea,
like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater &mdash;
when I thought of it &mdash; than the curious, inexplicable note of
desperate grief in this savage clamour that had swept by us on the
river-bank, behind the blind whiteness of the fog.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;Two pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as
to which bank. &lsquo;Left.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no; how can you?  Right,
right, of course.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is very serious,&rsquo; said the
manager's voice behind me; &lsquo;I would be desolated if anything
should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up.&rsquo; I looked at him,
and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. He was just the kind
of man who would wish to preserve appearances. That was his restraint.
But when he muttered something about going on at once, I did not even
take the trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew, that it was
impossible.  Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be
absolutely in the air &mdash; in space. We wouldn't be able to tell
where we were going to &mdash; whether up or down stream, or across
&mdash; till we fetched against one bank or the other &mdash; and then
we wouldn't know at first which it was. Of course I made no move. I
had no mind for a smash-up. You couldn't imagine a more deadly place
for a shipwreck. Whether drowned at once or not, we were sure to
perish speedily in one way or another. &lsquo;I authorize you to take
all the risks,&rsquo; he said, after a short silence. &lsquo;I refuse
to take any,&rsquo; I said shortly; which was just the answer he
expected, though its tone might have surprised him. &lsquo;Well, I
must defer to your judgment. You are captain,&rsquo; he said with
marked civility. I turned my shoulder to him in sign of my
appreciation, and looked into the fog.  How long would it last? It was
the most hopeless lookout. The approach to this Kurtz grubbing for
ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he
had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous
castle. &lsquo;Will they attack, do you think?&rsquo; asked the
manager, in a confidential tone.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I did not think they would attack, for several
obvious reasons. The thick fog was one. If they left the bank in their
canoes they would get lost in it, as we would be if we attempted to
move. Still, I had also judged the jungle of both banks quite
impenetrable &mdash; and yet eyes were in it, eyes that had seen us.
The riverside bushes were certainly very thick; but the undergrowth
behind was evidently penetrable.  However, during the short lift I had
seen no canoes anywhere in the reach &mdash; certainly not abreast of
the steamer. But what made the idea of attack inconceivable to me was
the nature of the noise &mdash; of the cries we had heard. They had
not the fierce character boding immediate hostile
intention. Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had
given me an irresistible impression of sorrow. The glimpse of the
steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained
grief. The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a
great human passion let loose. Even extreme grief may ultimately vent
itself in violence &mdash; but more generally takes the form of
apathy&hellip;</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;You should have seen the pilgrims stare! They had no
heart to grin, or even to revile me: but I believe they thought me
gone mad &mdash; with fright, maybe.  I delivered a regular
lecture. My dear boys, it was no good bothering. Keep a lookout? Well,
you may guess I watched the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat
watches a mouse; but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to
us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of cotton-wool. It
felt like it, too &mdash; choking, warm, stifling. Besides, all I
said, though it sounded extravagant, was absolutely true to fact.
What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an attempt at
repulse. The action was very far from being aggressive &mdash; it was
not even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken under the
stress of desperation, and in its essence was purely
protective.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;It developed itself, I should say, two hours after
the fog lifted, and its commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking,
about a mile and a half below Kurtz's station. We had just floundered
and flopped round a bend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock
of bright green, in the middle of the stream.  It was the only thing
of the kind; but as we opened the reach more, I perceived it was the
head of a long sand-bank, or rather of a chain of shallow patches
stretching down the middle of the river. They were discoloured, just
awash, and the whole lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a
man's backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the
skin. Now, as far as I did see, I could go to the right or to the left
of this. I didn't know either channel, of course. The banks looked
pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same; but as I had been
informed the station was on the west side, I naturally headed for the
western passage.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became
aware it was much narrower than I had supposed. To the left of us
there was the long uninterrupted shoal, and to the right a high, steep
bank heavily overgrown with bushes. Above the bush the trees stood in
serried ranks. The twigs overhung the current thickly, and from
distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over
the stream. It was then well on in the afternoon, the face of the
forest was gloomy, and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on
the water. In this shadow we steamed up &mdash; very slowly, as you
may imagine. I sheered her well inshore &mdash; the water being
deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding
in the bows just below me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked
scow. On the deck, there were two little teakwood houses, with doors
and windows.  The boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right
astern. Over the whole there was a light roof, supported on
stanchions. The funnel projected through that roof, and in front of
the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a
pilot-house. It contained a couch, two camp-stools, a loaded
Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny table, and the
steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at
each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I spent my
days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof, before the
door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An athletic black
belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor predecessor, was
the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a blue cloth
wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the world of
himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen. He
steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost
sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and
would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a
minute.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling
much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that
river, when I saw my poleman give up the business suddenly, and
stretch himself flat on the deck, without even taking the trouble to
haul his pole in. He kept hold on it though, and it trailed in the
water. At the same time the fireman, whom I could also see below me,
sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head. I was
amazed. Then I had to look at the river mighty quick, because there
was a snag in the fairway. Sticks, little sticks, were flying about
&mdash; thick: they were whizzing before my nose, dropping below me,
striking behind me against my pilot-house. All this time the river,
the shore, the woods, were very quiet &mdash; perfectly quiet. I could
only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel and the patter
of these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by Jove! We
were being shot at!  I stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the
land-side.  That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was lifting
his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a
reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering within ten feet
of the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I
saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me
very fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been
removed from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked
breasts, arms, legs, glaring eyes &mdash; the bush was swarming with
human limbs in movement, glistening, of bronze colour. The twigs
shook, swayed, and rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the
shutter came to. &lsquo;Steer her straight,&rsquo; I said to the
helmsman. He held his head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled,
he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his mouth foamed
a little. &lsquo;Keep quiet!&rsquo; I said in a fury. I might just as
well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind. I darted out.  Below
me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron deck; confused
exclamations; a voice screamed, &lsquo;Can you turn back?&rsquo; I
caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another
snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened
with their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that
bush. A deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I
swore at it. Now I couldn't see the ripple or the snag either. I stood
in the doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms.  They might
have been poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn't kill a
cat. The bush began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop;
the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my
shoulder, and the pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I
made a dash at the wheel.  The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to
throw the shutter open and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before
the wide opening, glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I
straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room
to turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near
ahead in that confounded smoke, there was no time to lose, so I just
crowded her into the bank &mdash; right into the bank, where I knew
the water was deep.</paragraph>


<paragraph>&ldquo;We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a
whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped
short, as I had foreseen it would when the squirts got empty. I threw
my head back to a glinting whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at
one shutter-hole and out at the other. Looking past that mad helmsman,
who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague
forms of men running bent double, leaping, gliding, distinct,
incomplete, evanescent. Something big appeared in the air before the
shutter, the rifle went overboard, and the man stepped back swiftly,
looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary, profound, familiar
manner, and fell upon my feet. The side of his head hit the wheel
twice, and the end of what appeared a long cane clattered round and
knocked over a little campstool.  It looked as though after wrenching
that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance in the
effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were clear of the snag, and
looking ahead I could see that in another hundred yards or so I would
be free to sheer off, away from the bank; but my feet felt so very
warm and wet that I had to look down. The man had rolled on his back
and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched that cane. It
was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lunged through the
opening, had caught him in the side just below the ribs; the blade had
gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my shoes were
full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under the
wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing lustre. The fusillade burst out
again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something
precious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from
him. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend
to the steering. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of
the steam whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly. The
tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from
the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail
of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the
flight of the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in
the bush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out
sharply &mdash; then silence, in which the languid beat of the
stern-wheel came plainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard
at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated,
appeared in the doorway. &lsquo;The manager sends me &mdash;&rsquo; he
began in an official tone, and stopped short. &lsquo;Good God!&rsquo;
he said, glaring at the wounded man.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and
inquiring glance enveloped us both. I declare it looked as though he
would presently put to us some question in an understandable language;
but he died without uttering a sound, without moving a limb, without
twitching a muscle. Only in the very last moment, as though in
response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper we could not
hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown gave to his black death-mask
an inconceivably sombre, brooding, and menacing expression. The lustre
of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness. &lsquo;Can
you steer?&rsquo; I asked the agent eagerly. He looked very dubious;
but I made a grab at his arm, and he understood at once I meant him to
steer whether or no. To tell you the truth, I was morbidly anxious to
change my shoes and socks. &lsquo;He is dead,&rsquo; murmured the
fellow, immensely impressed. &lsquo;No doubt about it,&rsquo; said I,
tugging like mad at the shoe laces. &lsquo;And by the way, I suppose
Mr.  Kurtz is dead as well by this time.&rsquo;</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;For the moment that was the dominant thought.  There
was a sense of extreme disappointment, as though I had found out I had
been striving after something altogether without a substance. I
couldn't have been more disgusted if I had travelled all this way for
the sole purpose of talking with Mr. Kurtz. Talking with &hellip; I
flung one shoe overboard, and became aware that that was exactly what
I had been looking forward to &mdash; a talk with Kurtz. I made the
strange discovery that I had never imagined him as doing, you know,
but as discoursing. I didn't say to myself, &lsquo;Now I will never
see him,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Now I will never shake him by the
hand,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;Now I will never hear him.&rsquo; The man
presented himself as a voice. Not of course that I did not connect him
with some sort of action.  Hadn't I been told in all the tones of
jealousy and admiration that he had collected, bartered, swindled, or
stolen more ivory than all the other agents together?  That was not
the point. The point was in his being a gifted creature, and that of
all his gifts the one that stood out preeminently, that carried with
it a sense of real presence, was his ability to talk, his words
&mdash; the gift of expression, the bewildering, the illuminating, the
most exalted and the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light,
or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable
darkness.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;The other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of
that river. I thought, &lsquo;By Jove! it's all over. We are too late;
he has vanished &mdash; the gift has vanished, by means of some spear,
arrow, or club. I will never hear that chap speak after all&rsquo;
&mdash; and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion, even
such as I had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the
bush. I couldn't have felt more of lonely desolation somehow, had I
been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in life&hellip; Why
do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody? Absurd? Well, absurd. Good
Lord! mustn't a man ever &mdash; Here, give me some
tobacco.&rdquo;&hellip;</paragraph>

<paragraph>There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match
flared, and Marlow's lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward
folds and dropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated abtention;
and as he took vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and
advance out of the night in the regular flicker of tiny flame. The
match went out.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This is the worst of
trying to tell&hellip; Here you all are, each moored with two good
addresses, like a hulk with two anchors, a butcher round one corner, a
policeman round another, excellent appetites, and temperature normal
&mdash; you hear &mdash; normal from year's end to year's end. And you
say, Absurd! Absurd be &mdash; exploded! Absurd! My dear boys, what
can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness had just flung
overboard a pair of new shoes! Now I think of it, it is amazing I did
not shed tears. I am, upon the whole, proud of my fortitude.  I was
cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable privilege
of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I was wrong. The privilege
was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than enough.  And I was
right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a voice. And I heard
&mdash; him &mdash; it &mdash; this voice &mdash; other voices &mdash;
all of them were so little more than voices &mdash; and the memory of
that time itself lingers around me, impalpable, like a dying vibration
of one immense jabber, silly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply
mean, without any kind of sense. Voices, voices &mdash; even the girl
herself &mdash; now &mdash;&rdquo;</paragraph>

<paragraph>He was silent for a long time.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a
lie,&rdquo; he began, suddenly. &ldquo;Girl! What? Did I mention a
girl?  Oh, she is out of it &mdash; completely. They &mdash; the women
I mean &mdash; are out of it &mdash; should be out of it. We must help
them to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours gets
worse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the
disinterred body of Mr. Kurtz saying, &lsquo;My Intended.&rsquo; You
would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of
it. And the lofty frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on
growing sometimes, but this &mdash; ah &mdash; specimen, was
impressively bald. The wilderness had patted him on the head, and,
behold, it was like a ball &mdash; an ivory ball; it had caressed him,
and &mdash; lo! &mdash; he had withered; it had taken him, loved him,
embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his
soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish
initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite. Ivory? I should
think so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting
with it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above
or below the ground in the whole country. &lsquo;Mostly fossil,&rsquo;
the manager had remarked, disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I
am; but they call it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these
niggers do bury the tusks sometimes &mdash; but evidently they
couldn't bury this parcel deep enough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz
from his fate. We filled the steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot
on the deck. Thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see,
because the appreciation of this favour had remained with him to the
last. You should have heard him say, &lsquo;My ivory.&rsquo; Oh, yes,
I heard him. &lsquo;My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my
&mdash;&rsquo; everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath
in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal
of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their
places. Everything belonged to him &mdash; but that was a trifle. The
thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of darkness
claimed him for their own. That was the reflection that made you
creepy all over. It was impossible &mdash; it was not good for one
either &mdash; trying to imagine. He had taken a high seat amongst the
devils of the land &mdash; I mean literally. You can't understand. How
could you? &mdash; with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by
kind neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping
delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror
of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums &mdash; how can you imagine
what particular region of the first ages a man's untrammelled feet may
take him into by the way of solitude &mdash; utter solitude without a
policeman &mdash; by the way of silence &mdash; utter silence, where
no warning voice of a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public
opinion? These little things make all the great difference. When they
are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength, upon your
own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you may be too much of a fool
to go wrong &mdash; too dull even to know you are being assaulted by
the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made a bargain for his
soul with the devil; the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too
much of a devil &mdash; I don't know which. Or you may be such a
thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to
anything but heavenly sights and sounds. Then the earth for you is
only a standing place &mdash; and whether to be like this is your loss
or your gain I won't pretend to say. But most of us are neither one
nor the other. The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must
put up with sights, with sounds, with smells, too, by Jove! &mdash;
breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be contaminated. And there,
don't you see? Your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for
the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in &mdash; your
power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an obscure back-breaking
business.  And that's difficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to
excuse or even explain &mdash; I am trying to account to myself for
&mdash; for &mdash; Mr. Kurtz &mdash; for the shade of Mr. Kurtz. This
initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with its amazing
confidence before it vanished altogether. This was because it could
speak English to me. The original Kurtz had been educated partly in
England, and &mdash; as he was good enough to say himself &mdash; his
sympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his
father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz;
and by and by I learned that, most appropriately, the International
Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with
the making of a report, for its future guidance.  And he had written
it, too. I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with
eloquence, but too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close
writing he had found time for! But this must have been before his
&mdash; let us say &mdash; nerves, went wrong, and caused him to
preside at certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites,
which &mdash; as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I heard at
various times &mdash; were offered up to him &mdash; do you
understand?  &mdash; to Mr. Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful
piece of writing. The opening paragraph, however, in the light of
later information, strikes me now as ominous. He began with the
argument that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived
at, &lsquo;must necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of
supernatural beings &mdash; we approach them with the might as of a
deity,&rsquo; and so on, and so on. &lsquo;By the simple exercise of
our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded,&rsquo;
etc., etc. From that point he soared and took me with him. The
peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember, you know. It
gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august
Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the unbounded
power of eloquence &mdash; of words &mdash; of burning noble
words. There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of
phrases, unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled
evidently much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the
exposition of a method.  It was very simple, and at the end of that
moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous
and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky:
&lsquo;Exterminate all the brutes!&rsquo; The curious part was that he
had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum,
because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he repeatedly
entreated me to take good care of &lsquo;my pamphlet&rsquo; (he called
it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his
career. I had full information about all these things, and, besides,
as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. I've done
enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I
choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst
all the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of
civilization. But then, you see, I can't choose. He won't be
forgotten. Whatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to
charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in
his honour; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with
bitter misgivings: he had one devoted friend at least, and he had
conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor
tainted with self-seeking. No; I can't forget him, though I am not
prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in
getting to him. I missed my late helmsman awfully &mdash; I missed him
even while his body was still lying in the pilot-house.  Perhaps you
will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more
account than a grain of sand in a black Sahara. Well, don't you see,
he had done something, he had steered; for months I had him at my back
&mdash; a help &mdash; an instrument. It was a kind of partnership. He
steered for me &mdash; I had to look after him, I worried about his
deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only
became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the intimate profundity
of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day
in my memory &mdash; like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a
supreme moment.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;Poor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone.
He had no restraint, no restraint just like Kurtz &mdash; a tree
swayed by the wind. As soon as I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I
dragged him out, after first jerking the spear out of his side, which
operation I confess I performed with my eyes shut tight. His heels
leaped together over the little doorstep; his shoulders were pressed
to my breast; I hugged him from behind desperately.  Oh! he was heavy,
heavy; heavier than any man on earth, I should imagine. Then without
more ado I tipped him overboard. The current snatched him as though he
had been a wisp of grass, and I saw the body roll over twice before I
lost sight of it for ever. All the pilgrims and the manager were then
congregated on the awning-deck about the pilot-house, chattering at
each other like a flock of excited magpies, and there was a
scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude. What they wanted to
keep that body hanging about for I can't guess. Embalm it, maybe.  But
I had also heard another, and a very ominous, murmur on the deck
below. My friends the wood-cutters were likewise scandalized, and with
a better show of reason &mdash; though I admit that the reason itself
was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up my mind that if my
late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have him. He
had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was dead
he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause some
startling trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the man
in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the
business.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;This I did directly the simple funeral was over.  We
were going half-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and
I listened to the talk about me.  They had given up Kurtz, they had
given up the station; Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt
&mdash; and so on &mdash; and so on. The red-haired pilgrim was beside
himself with the thought that at least this poor Kurtz had been
properly avenged. &lsquo;Say! We must have made a glorious slaughter
of them in the bush. Eh? What do you think? Say?&rsquo; He positively
danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar. And he had nearly
fainted when he saw the wounded man!  I could not help saying,
&lsquo;You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.&rsquo; I had seen,
from the way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all
the shots had gone too high. You can't hit anything unless you take
aim and fire from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip
with their eyes shut. The retreat, I maintained &mdash; and I was
right &mdash; was caused by the screeching of the steam whistle. Upon
this they forgot Kurtz, and began to howl at me with indignant
protests.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;The manager stood by the wheel murmuring
confidentially about the necessity of getting well away down the river
before dark at all events, when I saw in the distance a clearing on
the riverside and the outlines of some sort of building. &lsquo;What's
this?&rsquo; I asked. He clapped his hands in wonder. &lsquo;The
station!&rsquo; he cried. I edged in at once, still going
half-speed.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill
interspersed with rare trees and perfectly free from undergrowth.  A
long decaying building on the summit was half buried in the high
grass; the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar; the
jungle and the woods made a background. There was no enclosure or
fence of any kind; but there had been one apparently, for near the
house half-a-dozen slim posts remained in a row, roughly trimmed, and
with their upper ends ornamented with round carved balls. The rails,
or whatever there had been between, had disappeared.  Of course the
forest surrounded all that.  The river-bank was clear, and on the
waterside I saw a white man under a hat like a cartwheel beckoning
persistently with his whole arm. Examining the edge of the forest
above and below, I was almost certain I could see movements &mdash;
human forms gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently, then
stopped the engines and let her drift down. The man on the shore began
to shout, urging us to land. &lsquo;We have been attacked,&rsquo;
screamed the manager. &lsquo;I know &mdash; I know. It's all
right,&rsquo; yelled back the other, as cheerful as you
please. &lsquo;Come along. It's all right. I am
glad.&rsquo;</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;His aspect reminded me of something I had seen
&mdash; something funny I had seen somewhere. As I manoeuvred to get
alongside, I was asking myself, &lsquo;What does this fellow look
like?&rsquo; Suddenly I got it.  He looked like a harlequin. His
clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably,
but it was covered with patches all over, with bright patches, blue,
red, and yellow &mdash; patches on the back, patches on the front,
patches on elbows, on knees; coloured binding around his jacket,
scarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sunshine made
him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could
see how beautifully all this patching had been done. A beardless,
boyish face, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little
blue eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open
countenance like sunshine and shadow on a wind-swept
plain. &lsquo;Look out, captain!&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;there's a
snag lodged in here last night.&rsquo; What! Another snag?  I confess
I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off that
charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug-nose up
to me. &lsquo;You English?&rsquo; he asked, all smiles. &lsquo;Are
you?&rsquo; I shouted from the wheel. The smiles vanished, and he
shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment. Then he brightened
up. &lsquo;Never mind!&rsquo; he cried encouragingly.  &lsquo;Are we
in time?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;He is up there,&rsquo; he replied,
with a toss of the head up the hill, and becoming gloomy all of a
sudden. His face was like the autumn sky, overcast one moment and
bright the next.</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;When the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of
them armed to the teeth, had gone to the house this chap came on
board. &lsquo;I say, I don't like this.  These natives are in the
bush,&rsquo; I said. He assured me earnestly it was all
right. &lsquo;They are simple people,&rsquo; he added; &lsquo;well, I
am glad you came. It took me all my time to keep them off.&rsquo;
&lsquo;But you said it was all right,&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Oh, they
meant no harm,&rsquo; he said; and as I stared he corrected himself,
&lsquo;Not exactly.&rsquo; Then vivaciously, &lsquo;My faith, your
pilot-house wants a clean-up!&rsquo; In the next breath he advised me
to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any
trouble. &lsquo;One good screech will do more for you than all your
rifles. They are simple people,&rsquo; he repeated. He rattled away at
such a rate he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up
for lots of silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the
case. &lsquo;Don't you talk with Mr. Kurtz?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You
don't talk with that man &mdash; you listen to him,&rsquo; he
exclaimed with severe exaltation. &lsquo;But now &mdash;&rsquo; He
waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost
depths of despondency. In a moment he came up again with a jump,
possessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously, while he
gabbled: &lsquo;Brother sailor &hellip; honour &hellip; pleasure
&hellip; delight &hellip;introduce myself &hellip; Russian &hellip;
son of an arch-priest &hellip; Government of Tambov &hellip; What?
Tobacco! English tobacco; the excellent English tobacco! Now, that's
brotherly. Smoke?  Where's a sailor that does not
smoke?&rsquo;</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;The pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he
had run away from school, had gone to sea in a Russian ship; ran away
again; served some time in English ships; was now reconciled with the
arch-priest.  He made a point of that. &lsquo;But when one is young
one must see things, gather experience, ideas; enlarge the
mind.&rsquo; &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; I interrupted. &lsquo;You can never
tell! Here I met Mr. Kurtz,&rsquo; he said, youth fully solemn and
reproachful. I held my tongue after that. It appears he had persuaded
a Dutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores and
goods, and had started for the interior with a light heart and no more
idea of what would happen to him than a baby. He had been wandering
about that river for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody
and everything. &lsquo;I am not so young as I look. I am
twenty-five,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;At first old Van Shuyten would
tell me to go to the devil,&rsquo; he narrated with keen enjoyment;
&lsquo;but I stuck to him, and talked and talked, till at last he got
afraid I would talk the hind-leg off his favourite dog, so he gave me
some cheap things and a few guns, and told me he hoped he would never
see my face again. Good old Dutchman, Van Shuyten. I've sent him one
small lot of ivory a year ago, so that he can't call me a little thief
when I get back. I hope he got it. And for the rest I don't care. I
had some wood stacked for you. That was my old house. Did you
see?&rsquo;</paragraph>

<paragraph>&ldquo;I gave him Towson's book. He made as though he would
kiss me, but restrained himself. &lsquo;The only book I had left, and
I thought I had lost it,&rsquo; he said, looking at it
ecstatically. &lsquo;So many accidents happen to a man going about
alone, you know. Canoes get upset sometimes &mdash; and sometimes
you've got to clear out so quick when the people get angry.&rsquo; He
thumbed the pages.  &lsquo;You made notes in Russian?&rsquo; I
asked. He nodded. &lsquo;I thought they were written in cipher,&rsquo;
I said. He laughed, then became serious. &lsquo;I had lots of trouble
to keep these people off,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Did they want to kill
you?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; he cried, and checked
himself. &lsquo;Why did they attack us?&rsquo; I pursued. He
hesitated, then said shamefacedly, &lsquo;They don't want him to
go.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don't they?&rsquo; I said curiously. He nodded a nod
full of mystery and wisdom. &lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;this man has enlarged my mind.&rsquo; He opened his arms wide,
staring at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly
round.&rdquo;</paragraph>
