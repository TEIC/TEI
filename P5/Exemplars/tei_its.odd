<head>TEI schema including W3C ITS information</head>
  <p>The <ref target="http://www.w3.org/International/its/">The
  Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)</ref> Working Group is part of
  the W3C Internationalization Activity.  It has developed a set of
  elements and attributes that can be used with  DTDs/Schemas to
  support the internationalization and localization of documents; and
  provide best practice techniques for developers of DTDs/Schemas that
  show how to enable internationalization of their documents. This TEI
  customization adds the ITS markup to the TEI scheme.</p>
