	Lou assures me "dont" is correct spelling from Shaw's original 1916 edition, so I've removed my suspicious comment.

	Changed paths:
	   M /trunk/P5/Source/Guidelines/en/DR-PerformanceTexts.xml

	Datatype for @n did not match value description (Bug # 3441933). I've therefore expanded the valDesc as follows:

	"The value consists of one or more instances of data.word. Each instance may contain only letters, digits, punctuation
	characters, or symbols: it may not contain whitespace or word
	separating characters. It need not be restricted to
	numbers."

	Many changes relating to language codes. I've fixed erroneous codes, such as "kr" instead of "ko" for Korean; I've upper-cased two-letter region or country codes forming the second part of a language code (so "zh-cn" becomes "zh-CN"); I've replaced the non-conformant "zh-archaic" with "och" (Old Chinese); and otherwise brought language code usage into compliance with BCP 47 and our own instructions in the CH chapter. This is for ticket 3304622.

	The aim is to reconsider the way some modules add extra elements to common situations. Remove mix.* and gen.* macros entirely, instead making the relevant model classes members of model.common; hence remove macro.component, as it only now points to model.common; adjust prose in chapters (especially ST) to cover this removal of a whole layer of macros

2005-01-28  Syd Bauman  <sbauman@brown.edu>
	Changed paths:
	   M /trunk/P5/Roma

	Lots of various minor changes to improve general code & documentation;
	one major change: we now use XSLT (specifically extract-schemaSpec-
	ident.xsl) to get the value of ident= of the 1st <schemaSpec> in the
	specified file.
	Also now a bash script instead of an sh script. I'm not sure that was
	necessary -- I'm just used to writing in bash, and that's the
	scripting language for which I hve ready access to good documentation.
