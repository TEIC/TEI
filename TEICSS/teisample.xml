     I have endeavoured in this
            <emph>Ghostly</emph> little book, to raise the
            <emph>Ghost</emph> of an xml:idea, which shall not put my
            readers out of humour with themselves, with each other,
            with the season, or with me.  May it haunt their houses
            pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it. </p> <signed> Their
            faithful Friend and Servant, C.D. <date>December,
            1843.</date>

               <head>Marley's Ghost</head>
               <p>Marley was dead: to begin with.  There is no doubt whatever
about that.  The register of his burial was signed by the
clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. 
Scrooge signed it.  And Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change,
for anything he chose to put his hand to.  Old Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.</p>
