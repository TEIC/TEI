      <p>This version of the TEI Guidelines introduces new features
      and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI community. As
      always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a
      consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI
      community using the SourceForge tracking system. If you find
      something you think needs to change in the TEI Guidelines,
      schemas, tools, or website, please submit a feature request or
      bug ticket at <ref target="http://tei.sf.net/">http://tei.sf.net/</ref> for consideration.

      enumerated list of values.</item>

      <item>The prose of the Guidelines and the element specification
      for <gi>list</gi> have been changed to differentiate between the
      <att>type</att> attribute, which should be used to identify the
      category of list, and the rendering attributes (<att>rend</att>,
      <att>style</att>, and <att>rendition</att>) which should be used
      to indicate how the list is rendered. Per <ptr target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/460/"/>.</item>

	<item>The element specification for <gi>education</gi> was
	enhanced to show an example using the <att>from</att> and
	<att>to</att> attributes as well as the <att>notBefore</att>
	and <att>notAfter</att> attributes, to suggest more precise
	ways of indicating dates, if appropriate. Per <ptr target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/654/"/>.</item>

	<item>The <gi>listRelation</gi> element and members of <name type="class">model.headLike</name> are now permitted as

	<item>A new metadata element, <gi>punctuation</gi>, has been
	added to <name type="class">model.editorialDeclPart</name> for
	describing editorial practice with respect to punctuation
	marks.</item>

	<item>The <gi>surfaceGrp</gi> element was removed from <name type="class">att.coordinated</name>, thus losing the
	<att>start</att>, <att>ulx</att>, <att>uly</att>,
	<att>lrx</att>, <att>lry</att>, and <att>points</att>
	attributes, per <ptr target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/679/"/>.</item>

      </list>
      </p>

      <p>In addition, improvements have been made to the XSL
      stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma

      are maintained separately from the Guidelines and are at <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>.</p>
