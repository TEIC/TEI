          <head>Introduction</head>
          <p>This chapter defines a module for encoding terminological resources as they are usually
            used in a wide range of task oriented applications such as technical writing,
            translating or domain-specific language learning. It implements an adaptation of ISO
            standard 320042 (TBX — TermBase eXchange) that optimises the re-use of TEI constructs in
            combination with TBX elements. TBX is itself an application of ISO standard 16642 (TMF —
            Terminology Markup Framework) which provides a meta-model for the description of
            terminologies and other onomasiological structures. This chapter is complementary to the
              <ref target="#DI">Dictionaries</ref> chapter of these Guidelines, which focuses on
            word to sense lexical (that is, semasiological) structures.</p>
          <p>Terminologies implement a concept-to-term (that is, onomasiological) representation of
            lexical information where the words are organised according to the concepts they
            express. This form of representation, initiated by scholars such as Eugen Wüster who
            worked on specialised lexica (<bibl>Wüster, E.: Einführung in die allgemeine
              Terminologielehre und terminolo- gische Lexikographie.</bibl><!-- date?-->), is intended to
            represent the vocabulary specific to particular application domains. It is also essential for
            software environments such as indexing, machine translation, or documentary systems.<!-- what are these? and why? --></p>
          <p>The representation of terminologies is based on two underlying principles:</p>
          <list>
            <item>Concept orientation: All terminological information pertaining to one concept
              including all terms (designing <!-- designating ? --> this concept) in all languages and all descriptive and
              administrative data is handled as one terminological unit </item>
            <item>Term autonomy: All terms belonging to one concept should be managed (in one
              terminological entry) as autonomous (repeatable) blocks of data categories without any
              preference for a specific term.<note>This is typically where terminologies differ from
                simpler forms of conceptual representations such as thesauri (see, for instance, the
                simplified SKOS model)</note></item>
            <!-- a formal definition of what is meant by "term" would be helpful here -->
          </list> 
          <p>As a consequence, a terminological entry is organised, following the principles of TMF,
            as a 3-level representation:</p>
          <list>
            <item>The Terminological Entry (TE) level, implemented as <gi>termEntry</gi>, that
              represents a concept within a given subject field.</item>
            <item>The Language Section (LS) level, implemented as <gi>langSet</gi> that groups
              together all terminological descriptions for a specific language.</item>
            <item>The Term Section (TS), implemented as <gi>tig</gi> that contains all information
              related to a given term, comprising its graphical or phonetic representations.</item>
          </list>
          <p>In its simplest form, a terminological entry will provide a structure around
            multilingual terms considered as equivalent expressions for the same concept. For
            instance, an entry from a trilingual glossary (<bibl>de La Quille a la Pomme de Mat:
              Dictionnaire de Marine En Anglais, Francais Et Allemand (1885) Heinrich Paasch</bibl>)
            can be represented as follows: </p>

            SKOS and other Thesaurus standards. Objectif of this chapter: record and convey precise
            terminological information which in turn can be presented as flatter structures (in a
            LOFD perspective)</p> <!-- ? -->

          <p>An inventory of types of data (called <soCalled>data categories</soCalled> by terminologists) for
            recording terminology has been defined in <title>ISO 12620:1999 — Computer applications in
            Terminology — Data categories</title>. However, language industries typically require only a
            small subset of the data categories that are defined in that standard. 
            <!-- ? isnt that the point? iand what is relevance of this to tbx? -->
          </p>
          <p> smaller selection of data categories than TBX basic (but could be extended), entry
            point (termEntry), integration with TEI mechanisms (pointing, inline textual
            annotations, graphics, dictionary pbjects gramGrp, cit/. TBX often offers shallower or
            plain text construct where the TEI (e.g. for bibliographical references) offers highly
            ellaborated mechanisms. The present chapter offers both options and elicit when
            necessary the tenets of the alternative.</p> 
          <p>Compliance with ISO 30042 <!-- shd be 320042 I assume? -->=> termEntry level; syntactic compliance: element can change
            namespace and termEntries be put in a TBX document. semantic compliance: possible to
            generate plain TBX entries without loss of information from TEI embedded termEntry
            elements </p>

              <head>Definitions</head>
              <p>The definition is arguably the data category that offers the most value to users
                apart from the terms themselves. The ISO 704:2000 standard, Terminology work–
                Principles and methods, provides comprehensive guidelines for writing terminological
                definitions. Following the ISO model, a definition is a sentence that explains the
                meaning of a term by a) identifying the class to which the term belongs and b)
                describing the characteristics that distinguish this term from other terms in this
                class. </p>
              <p>Example: <term>pacemaker</term>
                <gloss>implantable medical device that treats abnormal heart rhythms</gloss></p>
              <p>As this example illustrates, a terminological definition is not the same as a
                lexicographical definition, which aims at providing a complete description of all
                senses of a term. </p><!-- how does this example demonstrate that? I am none the wiser --> 
            </div>
            <div>
              <head>Subject fields </head>
              <p>Most localization companies managing terminology also collect
                categorical information, such as subject fields, product identifiers, and so forth.
                Such information is essential for translation and localization business processes. </p>
              <p>Well-organized and consistently applied categorical information can play an
                important role in disambiguation. Disambiguation refers to the process of clarifying
                the meaning of a term, where the term is used, or how the term is differentiated from
                other terms. Categorical information, combined with grammatical and contextual
                information, can help to narrow the scope of a term. In this sense, it has great
                practical value in the translation process.</p>
              <p>Categorical information can also be used for filtering and sorting. Many
                localization companies need to filter their terminology data for use in specific
                translation environments or for reviewing purposes, and they use categorical
                fieldsto do this.</p>
              <p>At least one field with categorical information per concept (entry) is recommended
                for terminology databases. A widely used categorical data field is "subject field"
                or "domain." ISO 12620 defines a subject field as "an area of human knowledge to
                which a terminological record is assigned."</p>
              <p>Typically, categorical information like subject fields are chosen from a picklist. <!-- define please -->
                The use of a picklist ensures that the values are entered correctly and that they are
                standardized.</p>
              <p>Multiple subject fields can be assigned to a concept, both on the same level
                (biology + chemistry) or in a hierarchicalstructure (technical -> heavy machinery ->
                wheel loaders). </p>

            <p>term vs. form</p>
            <p>The part of speech data category is required for the following purposes:</p>
            <list>
              <item>To differentiate homonyms, for instance, <mentioned>port</mentioned> is actually
                two terms in English: a noun, and a verb. <!-- I would say it has two senses --> 
                In a terminology database, each would be
                recorded in its own entry. Without a part of speech value in the entry, it can be
                difficult to determine which term the entry represents.</item>
              <item>To permit machine processing. Without a part of speech value, it is impossible
                to carry out certain software-assisted tasks in an automated fashion, such as
                importing a set of entries into an existing database. Importing would require human
                intervention to properly insert homonyms into their correct place in the target
                collection. Without a part of speech value, it is impossible to apply grammatical
                filters to facilitate search and export of data for specific purposes. And it would
                be impossible to use the terminology in extended applications such asspell checking
                programs.</item>
              <item>To enable blind interchange. Blind interchange refers to the ability to receive
                a terminology file and integrate it into a target system, such as a
                Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tool, without having to contact the originator
                of the file in order to understand its contents. When there is no part of speech
                value, it becomes necessary to discuss many of the entries with the originator in
                order to disambiguate their content.</item>
            </list>

            <p>The TBX standard defines two main grammatical data categories to qualify a term
                <tag>termNote type="partOfSpeech"</tag> noun; verb; adjective; adverb;
              properNoun</p>
            <p><tag>termNote type="grammaticalGender"</tag>
            </p>
            <p>From a TEI perspective and as described in the Dictionary chapter, the TEI guidelines
              also provides the <gi>gramGrp</gi> element to group together various grammatical
              information, which offers a wider range of descriptive possibilities. <gi>gramGrp</gi>
              can be used in alternation to the two <val>partOfSpeech</val> and
                <val>grammaticalGender</val> data categories on <gi>termNote</gi>. Semantic
              compliance with ISO 30046 when the <gi>gramGrp</gi> only contains <gi>pos</gi> and

            <p><tag>termNote type="termType"</tag> fullForm; acronym; abbreviation; shortForm;

            <p> This data category is useful for controlled authoring and controlled
