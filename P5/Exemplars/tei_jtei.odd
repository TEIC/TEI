        <head>Introduction</head>

        <p>This document introduces and documents the content and use of the schemas provided by the
          <title level="j">Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative</title>, as part of the TEI P5 distribution, 
          for the use of authors who want to submit their
          articles to the journal in TEI. The schema described in this document is highly
          constrained and restrictive, consisting only of some 80 elements, compared with the
          complete TEI schema which contains nearly six hundred. In addition to general structural constraints, 
          the ODD file also embeds fine-grained Schematron rules, severely limiting your options as you encode 
          your file.</p>

        <p>It is very likely that, as an experienced and confident TEI encoder with a broad
          knowledge of the TEI schema, you will find this at least a little frustrating. Where the
          TEI typically provides several ways of encoding the same phenomenon, we usually support
          only one. Where larger TEI schemas will allow you to describe rendering
          features (<tag>hi rend="italic"</tag>) we do not allow that; we force you to choose a
          conceptual tag such as <gi>emph</gi> or <tag>title level="j"</tag>. </p>

        <p>The reasons for this are fairly obvious. From the XML document you submit, we need to
          generate a range of different outputs—ODT for reviewers and copyeditors to read and
          annotate, OpenEdition XML for submission to the <ref target="http://wwww.lodel.org/"
            >lodel.org</ref> publication engine that supports the journal website, and an
          accompanying PDF version. We must enforce a degree of conformity across all submissions,
          not only in order to maintain consistency when we publish, but also to ensure that
          contributions are assessed by reviewers in as fair a manner as possible, without possible
          influences due to divergence from the expected style rules or formatting conventions.</p>

        <p>However, this constraint and conformity has advantages for you too, as an author. Our
          schemas will enforce a number of constraints which, we believe, may assist you in
          improving the quality of your article; these are a few of them: <list>
            <item><!-- [RvdB] problem: not all <quote> elements have accompanying <ref>:
                -jtei-6-Mandell-source.xml: the source for a blockquote is given in a <note>, since it isn't a bibliographical resource (but an email)
                [MDH] solution: we don't accept this in future. :-)            -->All
              quotations should be linked to references in the text.</item>
            <item>All references must be linked to bibliography items.</item>
            <item>All bibliography items must be cited somewhere in the text.</item>
            <item><!-- [RvdB] 2 exceptions:
                -jtei-6-Cummings-source.xml: v<hi rendition="#sup">li</hi> iij<hi rendition="#sup">s</hi> iiij<hi rendition="#sup">d</hi>
                [MDH] This is a good one; can't think of a solution there. The problem is that I don't have an easy way 
                of handling arbitrary CSS in <rendition>; it needs to know whether it's applying to a block level element, 
                an inline element, a list or whatever. We will need to standardize here.            -->All
              text styles such as italicization or quotation marks appear as a result of conceptual
              tags.</item>
          </list>
        </p>

        <p>In what follows, we aim to provide a readable guide to encoding your article (or perhaps
          even composing it) according to the journal schemas, beginning with the template we
          provide, and viewing your results as you work through the use of CSS (in Author Mode in
          Oxygen) or by transforming it into ODT for examination in your word-processor, or to
          PDF.</p>

        <p>This document is a work-in-progress (always), and we welcome your feedback at either <ref target="mailto:mholmes@uvic.ca">mholmes@uvic.ca</ref> (Martin Holmes) or <ref target="mailto:ron.vandenbranden@kantl.be">ron.vandenbranden@kantl.be</ref> (Ron Van den Branden).</p>

      <div xml:id="templates">
        <head>Using the Template</head>
        
        <p>Starting with version 16.2, the default distribution of Oxygen should include the jTEI 
          components as part of its built-in TEI P5 framework. If you are using an older version of 
          Oxygen, you can subscribe to the TEI-built version of the framework, by following <ref target="http://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/jamesc/2014/04/02/auto-update-your-tei-framework-in-oxygen/">these 
          instructions</ref>.</p>
        
        <p>  
          In Oxygen, you can start a new article based on the jTEI template by selecting <ident>File</ident> →
            <ident>New</ident>, and selecting <ident>JTEI Article [TEI P5]</ident> under
              <ident>Framework templates</ident> → <ident>TEI P5</ident>.</p> 
        <figure>
          <graphic url="images/new-from-jtei-template.png"/>
          <head type="legend">Selecting the <ident>jTEI article</ident> template in Oxygen.</head>
        </figure>
        <p>You will see that the root <gi>TEI</gi> element in the new file has an attribute 
          <att>rend</att>=<val>jTEI</val>. This tells 
          Oxygen that it's a jTEI file, so that it can apply standard
          jTEI rendering and validation scenarios to it. If you don't want to keep this 
          attribute value, you can achieve the same effect by saving the file with a 
          filename matching this format: <q>jtei-*-source.xml</q> (where the asterisk stands for 
          anything you like); Oxygen will also recognize files with names in this format as jTEI files.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div xml:id="testing">
        <head>Testing Your Document</head>
        <p>The Oxygen framework provides two output rendering scenarios, which allow you to
            transform your jTEI article to the ODT and PDF formats. Open the ODT file you create in
            a recent version of LibreOffice or OpenOffice; Microsoft Office does not support the
            current ODT specification. The PDF file can be viewed in a PDF viewer such as Adobe
            Reader. If you see any problems with the rendering, don't worry, and please don't change
            good TEI XML to bad TEI in an attempt to make it render more successfully; report the
            problem to us and we'll look into it.</p>

          <head>Divisions</head>
          <p>Text divisions are encoded in <gi>div</gi>. Each division must have a <gi>head</gi>
            containing the heading for this division. Headings should just contain the
              <soCalled>bare</soCalled> heading, without numbering or other labels; those are added
            automatically when the TEI source file is rendered.</p>
          <p>Divisions typically consist of a number of paragraphs, inside <gi>p</gi> elements.
            Apart from paragraphs, they can contain following text structures:<list>
              <item>subdivisions</item>
              <item>lists</item>
              <item>quotations</item>

              <item>tables</item>
              <item>code examples</item>
            </list></p>
          <p>Divisions can nest, by simply including a new <gi>div</gi> element with an
              <att>xml:id</att> attribute and a <gi>head</gi> in a parent division. There's no need
            to indicate the nesting level for subdivisions: this is determined from the structural
            encoding by the rendering scripts. Please note that the general TEI limitations hold:
            divisions may not be followed by <soCalled>bare</soCalled> paragraphs. In order to
            facilitate cross-referencing, you are encouraged to provide a unique identification code
            in an <att>xml:id</att> attribute for each <gi>div</gi>.</p>

          main components of a quotation are the quoted text itself, and a reference to the source

          quotation marks. Quotations marks are added automatically by the rendering
          scripts. The jTEI schema requires that each quotation is linked to a bibliographic reference, identifying the source from where the text has been quoted. Typically, the source of a quotation is listed in the bibliography at the end of the article. References to such sources are encoded in a <gi>ref</gi> element, with a <att>type</att> attribute of value <val>bibl</val>, whose <att>target</att> attribute must point to the <att>xml:id</att> value of a <gi>bibl</gi>

Omissions are encoded with <gi>gap</gi>, which at rendering time is transformed to the typographic omission symbol: <mentioned>…</mentioned><note place="foot">Note, if you're omitting text at the end of a sentence, the sentence punctuation should precede the <gi>gap</gi> element.</note>. If you supply text that wasn't present in the original quotation, you should wrap the supplied text in a <gi>supplied</gi> element.

Therefore, the general-purpose <gi>hi</gi> tag has been removed from the jTEI schema.<!-- [RvdB] On the condition we find a solution for things like the superscript in the Cummings article. --> Instead, you should use more semantically expressive elements for identifying the rhetorical phenomenon you want to encode. If you want to stress a word in a sentence, you can do so with the <gi>emph</gi> element, which is rendered as italicized text. Foreign terms can be tagged with <gi>foreign</gi>, with a proper language identification code for the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. Technical terms, or terms in general, can be encoded with <gi>term</gi>, and appear as italicized text in the rendered article.</p>

        <p>Another category of inline rhetorical elements are those that are used for text that is somehow quoted.

At rendering time, the start and end tag will be replaced with double quotation marks. Finally, if you want to quote a word or passage without attributing it to an external source, you can use the <gi>q</gi> element. Such <soCalled>anonymous</soCalled> quotations are rendered in double quotation marks.<note><p>The actual form of the quotation marks depends on the <soCalled>nesting level</soCalled> of quotation marks, so that double and single quotation marks alternate when they nest. For example, if a word tagged as <gi>soCalled</gi> appears inside a <gi>q</gi> element, then the quoted text will be wrapped in <emph>double</emph> quotation marks, while the text inside <gi>soCalled</gi> will be rendered with <emph>single</emph> quotation marks.</p></note></p>

        <head>Inline Technical Elements</head>
        <p>Due to the nature of this journal, a discussion of technical XML or TEI elements is a common feature in jTEI articles. When elements from an XML vocabulary are discussed, they should be identified in a <gi>gi</gi> element, with an optional <att>scheme</att> attribute in which the XML vocabulary can be named. The default value for this attribute is <val>TEI</val> for TEI elements; others could be <val>HTML</val>, <val>Schematron</val>, <val>DBK</val> (Docbook), etc. At rendering time, the <gi>gi</gi> start and end tags are replaced with the <mentioned>&lt;</mentioned> and <mentioned>&gt;</mentioned> characters, respectively. The element name is always presented in this form: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> in the output rendering, even if it is an empty element which in actual usage is almost always self-closing, such as <gi>lb</gi> or <gi>pb</gi>. </p>
        <p>Attribute names should be tagged in an <gi>att</gi> element, which at rendering time will be preceded with a <mentioned>@</mentioned> character. Attribute values should be tagged in <gi>val</gi>. At rendering time, the <gi>val</gi> start and end tags are replaced with straight quotation marks, so there is no need to quote the values yourself.</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <p>For example, the extension of credit can be represented in a transactionography

        </egXML>
        <p>When you want to quote an instance of a single start or end tag, you should use the <gi>tag</gi> element. If you want to specify the XML vocabulary this tag belongs to, this can be done in the <att>scheme</att> attribute (see above). In the <att>type</att> attribute, you can specify the kind of tag: <val>start</val> (start tag), <val>end</val> (end tag), <val>empty</val> (an empty tag), <val>pi</val> (processing instruction), <val>comment</val> (an XML comment), or <val>ms</val> (a CDATA marked section). For all these types of tags, the proper delimiters (starting with the <mentioned>&lt;</mentioned> and ending with the <mentioned>&gt;</mentioned> characters) are inserted when the article is rendered. Note, for full-fledged XML examples, the <gi>egXML</gi> element should be used (see <ptr target="#examples"/>).</p>

          <p>Most of the time, pointing from one part of a TEI document to another, it is easy

        <head>External Linking</head>
        <p><!--[RvdB] I haven't thought of this, but most of the external links in the articles so far are actually unlabeled: <ref target="https://github.com/hcayless/tei-xpointer.js">https://github.com/hcayless/tei-xpointer.js</ref>. Shouldn't those be replaced with <ptr/> instead? We could easily add a Schematron constraint that checks if a link label doesn't equal its target and suggest to change those to <ptr/>, or would that be a bridge too far?-->Links
          to external destinations can be encoded with <gi>ptr</gi> (unlabeled) or <gi>ref</gi>
          (labeled). They must have a <att>target</att> attribute whose value is the URI of the
          link's destination:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <item>addresses the range between two points (<ref
                target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/2.2.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SATSRN"
                >16.2.5.4 range()</ref>)</item>
          </egXML>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <p>More detailed information can be found at <ptr
                target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/2.5.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-elementSpec.html"
              />.</p>
          </egXML>At rendering time, both types of links are transformed to clickable hyperlinks,
          and for <gi>ptr</gi> the value of the <att>target</att> attribute is used as the link
          label.</p>
        <p>One caveat for external links to the TEI Guidelines: since the web version at <ptr
            target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/"/> is unstable and will be updated at each
          new release, you <emph>must</emph> point to the archived versions in the <ref
            target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Vault-GL.html"><soCalled>Vault</soCalled>
            section</ref> of the TEI website. There, you can find an archive of all previous TEI
          releases and their documentation. Follow the links to the exact version you're referencing
          in your article (even if it's the current version), and use them for your external
          hyperlinks. In the examples above, the first link points to the documentation of version
          2.2.0 of the TEI Guidelines, while the second link points to version 2.5.0.</p>

        <head>Frequently-asked Questions</head>
        <list>
          <item>Where did <gi>hi</gi> go? How do I do italics?
            <p>We're trying to avoid <gi>hi</gi> because it's so widely used in so 
            many different ways. We would also prefer that all styling be applied for
            semantic reasons, so rather than <soCalled>italics</soCalled>, think 
            <soCalled>journal title</soCalled> or <soCalled>emphasis</soCalled>
            or <soCalled>foreign word</soCalled>. Also, what you believe should be
            in italics might in our style guide be rendered in quotation marks, or not 
            styled at all; that's why it's easier if you identify things and let the system 
            style them.</p>
          </item>
          <item>Why can't I use quotation marks?
          <p>Literal quotation marks can be straight double, straight single, curly 
          double, curly single, or (if you happen to be on a non-English keyboard)
          a range of other symbols. All copyeditors are familiar with the tedium of 
          checking that they're all the right form, and that all the initial ones are 
          opening ones and the closing ones are the matching closing ones. It's much
          simpler if you tag your text as <gi>quote</gi>, <gi>soCalled</gi> or whatever,
          and let the XSLT provide the quotation marks in a reliable way.</p>
          </item>
          <item>Why is this so restrictive?
          <p>The TEI is a huge standard; there are lots of available approaches to 
          encoding any given phenomenon, and every TEI user has their own habits
          and preferences, arising out of their history and the projects they've worked
          on. If we accept submissions in any valid TEI (<soCalled>tei_all</soCalled>),
          we inevitably spend many hours re-encoding them to get something that 
          will work with our system. It's much simpler if we let the schema do the work
          for us.</p>
