        <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
        <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
        <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
        <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
        <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
        <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
        <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
        <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
        <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

        <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
        <p>CHRIST, the Eternal Son of God, the &#x17F;ub&#x17F;tance of all the Types and Shadows of the Law, was made a Prie&#x17F;t to God, <hi>not after the Law of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Commandment, but after the Power of an endle&#x17F;s Life.</hi> He came in the Power of the Father, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Power, he mini&#x17F;tred the Power and in the Power. Thus he gathered together living &#x17F;tones, built them into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Temple for the Father of life to dwell in, that they might be filled with the Power, dwell in the Power, and be to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Power. The Church of <hi>I&#x17F;rael,</hi> the Church of the Old Te&#x17F;tament, the Church of
<hi>Mo&#x17F;es,</hi> was gathered by the Letter, was to be ordered by the Letter, was to keep and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;erve the Law of the Letter, was to have Prie&#x17F;ts and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices according to the Letter: but the New Te&#x17F;tament Church was to be of true Jews, of Jews gathered in the Power, Circumci&#x17F;ed by the Power, renewed in the Power, &amp;c. So that he is not a Jew any longer, who is one outward, nor that Circumci&#x17F;ion, which is outward in the fle&#x17F;h; but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly, and Circumci&#x17F;ion is that of the heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter. We are the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ion, &#x17F;aith the Apo&#x17F;tle, which Wor&#x17F;hip God in the Spirit, and have no confidence in the fle&#x17F;h. The New-Te&#x17F;tament <pb facs="tcp:45699:3"/> &#x17F;tate is a &#x17F;tate of &#x17F;ub&#x17F;tance, even of that &#x17F;piritual &#x17F;ub&#x17F;tance, which the Law held out in &#x17F;hadows. The Jew is inward, the Circumci&#x17F;ion inward, the Sacrifices inward, the Church inward, the Mini&#x17F;try inward, the Wor&#x17F;hip inward: all is in Spirit, in Life, in Power, in Vertue; the whole &#x17F;tate is an&#x17F;werable to the High Prie&#x17F;t of our Profe&#x17F;&#x17F;ion, even <hi>after the Power of the endle&#x17F;s life.</hi> By the Eternal Spirit was he made a Mini&#x17F;ter, by it he preached (<hi>the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becau&#x17F;e he hath anointed me to preach the Go&#x17F;pel, &amp;c.</hi> Luke <hi>4.18.</hi>) through it he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;elf a Sacrifice without &#x17F;pot to God, <hi>Heb. 9.14.</hi> and in the &#x17F;ame Power runs the vein of the whole di&#x17F;pen&#x17F;ation of the Go&#x17F;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for it is a <hi>mini&#x17F;tration of the Spirit, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>3.8.</hi> Take away the Life, take away the Spirit, ye take away the &#x17F;tones of this Building, ye take away the Church, ye take away the Mini&#x17F;try, ye take away all.</p>
        <p>Now about this inward Building there was an outward Court, which had its Being, State, and Honour from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ence of the inward life. The vertue of the inward Building did ca&#x17F;t a reflection, and bring forth an outward &#x17F;tate (as it cannot but do, where ever it appears in its riches and glory.) This &#x17F;tate &#x17F;tood firm in the dayes of the Apo&#x17F;tles, till Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;uring and removing of his Temple, Altar and Wor&#x17F;hippers, and his giving up of the outward Court (it having lo&#x17F;t the life and vertue, which flowed into it from the Temple, while the Temple remained within it) to the Gentiles, who under the Go&#x17F;pel are &#x17F;uch as are Uncircumci&#x17F;ed in Spirit, &amp; can Wor&#x17F;hip in the outward Court without the Spirit. The enemy indeed fought hard again&#x17F;t the Life and Power, but he could not there prevail, the Gates of Hell could not prevail again&#x17F;t the true Church, which brought forth the Man-child, nor again&#x17F;t the Man-child whom &#x17F;he brought forth, but the Man-child was <pb facs="tcp:45699:3"/> caught up to God, and the Woman fled into the Wilderne&#x17F;&#x17F;e. Then that Church, State and Wor&#x17F;hip, which depended upon their pre&#x17F;ence, was di&#x17F;&#x17F;olved: For how could it be otherwi&#x17F;e, when both the Man-child, which was the Head of the Church (from whence the Vertue, Life and Influence did flow into the whole Body) and the Woman (or Church) her &#x17F;elf al&#x17F;o vvere both gone out of &#x17F;ight? So that the Mini&#x17F;try of Eternal life, &amp; the Temple, vvherein the life vvas mini&#x17F;tred, being both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, they are neither of them henceforvvard to be found in that place, vvhere they vvere beheld before, (and vvhere mo&#x17F;t eyes vvould be ready to look for them again) but there vvhere the Spirit had hid them.</p>
        <p>Novv mark diligently, vvhat kind of e&#x17F;teem the true Church hath had in the World, ever &#x17F;ince her di&#x17F;robing her &#x17F;elf of her outvvard garments and flight into the Wilderne&#x17F;s, and hovv her true Seed have been handled. The Dragon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ca&#x17F;ts a flood after her; her beautiful raiment being put off, and &#x17F;he clothed in the habit of a Widovv, the eye of the World could no longer &#x17F;ee and acknovvledge her to be the Church, but di&#x17F;dain, reproach, revile her. This is her lot all the dayes of Antichri&#x17F;t, &#x17F;he is mi&#x17F;repre&#x17F;ented by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons flood of reproaches, and looked upon as a &#x17F;trumpet, as one that pretends to Chri&#x17F;t for her Lord and Husband, to his Spirit, to his Kingdom, to his Truth vvithout a ju&#x17F;t right, and the remnant of her Seed are &#x17F;till made War vvith by the Dragon. Who have been the hunted ones, the hated, the per&#x17F;ecuted in all Nations, but the tender-con&#x17F;cienced, vvho receive the Lavv of Chri&#x17F;t into their hearts, bovving to him in their Wor&#x17F;hip and Conver&#x17F;ation, and dare not bovv or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;hip according to the Doctrines and Cammandments of men?</p>
        <p>Novv the true Church or Temple being thus removed, the outvvard Court becomes the Habitation and Place of Wor&#x17F;hip <pb facs="tcp:45699:4"/> among the Gentiles, all the time of the Churches abode in the Wilderne&#x17F;s. The Spirit of the Lord having left it, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theni&#x17F;h &#x17F;pirit (man's earthly Nature and Wi&#x17F;dom) the &#x17F;pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Antichri&#x17F;t enters into it, and upholds the Form of the former Building (&#x17F;o far as it judgeth nece&#x17F;&#x17F;ary) and here it is found Wor&#x17F;hipping, and making a great &#x17F;hevv of Holine&#x17F;s and devotion, but in the mean time makes War vvith the true Wor&#x17F;hippers, vvho cannot Wor&#x17F;hip in the outvvard Court (&#x17F;ince the Spirit of the Lord hath left it and given it to the Gentiles) but follovv the Church into the Wilderne&#x17F;s, and Wor&#x17F;hip in that Temple vvhich God hath removed thither.</p>
        <p>O vvhere is the eye vvhich can read the&#x17F;e things, as they are vvritten either in the Letter, or in the Spirit. Antichri&#x17F;t is a My&#x17F;tery of Iniquity, vvhich vvorks, and gets up, and reigns under an appearance of Godline&#x17F;s; and he that vvill di&#x17F;cern him and his fal&#x17F;e vvayes of Wor&#x17F;hip, mu&#x17F;t have that eye, vvhich &#x17F;ees beyond the appearance of things, into their nature: and in this is the Di&#x17F;covery of him, and the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from him. And happy is he, vvho is not <hi>defiled with Women,</hi> but abideth in the true <hi>Virginity,</hi> expecting and preparing for the appearance of the Bridegroom.</p>

        <head>The CONSIDERATION of a POSITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON concerning the Book of COMMON-PRAYER; As al&#x17F;o of &#x17F;ome Particulars held forth for Truths,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
        <p>THere is a Po&#x17F;ition laid down in &#x17F;ome Printed Letters, concerning the u&#x17F;e of the Common-Prayer-Book, tendred by one <hi>Edm. Elis</hi> (who profe&#x17F;&#x17F;eth him&#x17F;elf to be a Mini&#x17F;ter of Je&#x17F;us Chri&#x17F;t) to Mr. <hi>Hughes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ford</hi> (as he &#x17F;tileth them) again&#x17F;t which Po&#x17F;ition he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth me, if I find upon my Spirit any thing to be objected again&#x17F;t it, to di&#x17F;cover it in exact and punctual expre&#x17F;&#x17F;ions. This de&#x17F;ire of his is &#x17F;et down in Print after the Letters.</p>
        <p>His Po&#x17F;ition or A&#x17F;&#x17F;ertion is this: <hi>That a man may Wor&#x17F;hip God in Spirit, and in Truth in the u&#x17F;e of that form of Prayer for Morning and Evening, which we call the Common-Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
        <p>Now whoever would weigh this A&#x17F;&#x17F;ertion aright, mu&#x17F;t have the Ballance of the Sanctuary, and mu&#x17F;t put it into the Scale with an equal hand; and then looking with that eye, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to &#x17F;ee the Mi&#x17F;teries of the Kingdom of God, to him who is born of God, the Truth or Error of it is ea&#x17F;ily di&#x17F;cerned.</p>
        <p>
          <hi>True Prayer is the breathing of the Child to the Father which begat it, from the &#x17F;ence of its wants, for the &#x17F;upply of tho&#x17F;e wants.</hi>
        </p>
        <p><hi>The Winde bloweth where it li&#x17F;teth, and thou heare&#x17F;t the &#x17F;ound thereof, but can&#x17F;t not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: So is every one that is born of the Spirit, John</hi> 3.8. God by the Breath of his Spirit, begets a man out of the Spirit and likene&#x17F;s of this World, into his own image and likene&#x17F;&#x17F;e. He that is thus begotten: wants Nouri&#x17F;hment, wants the Divine Warmth, the Brea&#x17F;ts of Con&#x17F;olation, the Cloathing of the Spirit, the Garment of Salvation; wants the Bread of Life to feed on, wants the Water of Life to drink, wants &#x17F;trength again&#x17F;t the enemies A&#x17F;&#x17F;aults, wi&#x17F;dom again&#x17F;t his Snares and Temptations, wants the arm of the Deliverer to pre&#x17F;erve and carry on the <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45699:5"/> work of Redemption daily, wants Faith to deny the fle&#x17F;hly Wi&#x17F;dom, that &#x17F;o he may Tru&#x17F;t and Feel the Vertue of the Arm of the Deliverer, wants Hope, Patience, Meekne&#x17F;&#x17F;e, a clear Guidance, an upright Heart to follow after the Lord: yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many are the daily wants of that which is begotten by the Breath of God, in its &#x17F;tate of weakne&#x17F;&#x17F;e, until it be drawn up into the Unity of the Body, where the full Communion with the Life is felt, the Heart &#x17F;atisfied, and the wants drowned.</p>
        <p>Now the breathing of this Child to the Father, from the &#x17F;ence of the&#x17F;e wants, for his Supply, that's Prayer: nay though it be but a Groan, or Sigh, which cannot be uttered or expre&#x17F;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ed, yet that's Prayer, true Prayer, which hath an acceptance with the Lord, and receiveth a Gracious An&#x17F;wer from him: And he that begetteth the Child, teacheth him to Pray, even by the &#x17F;ame Spirit which begat him. In watching daily to the Spirit, the Child is kept &#x17F;en&#x17F;ible of the Will of the Father, and in his Light he &#x17F;ees the Way wherein he is to walk, he &#x17F;ees al&#x17F;o the Enemie when he is coming, yea and the Snares he is privily laying, and he feels his own weakne&#x17F;&#x17F;e to with&#x17F;tand or e&#x17F;cape: And in this &#x17F;ence his Heart cries to the Father of Spirits for Pre&#x17F;ervation, for him to &#x17F;tand by him, for him to &#x17F;tep in in the needful time, even in the Sea&#x17F;on of Di&#x17F;tre&#x17F;s. And thus, watching to the Spirit, the Life of a Chri&#x17F;tian is a continual cour&#x17F;e of Prayer: <hi>He prayes continually.</hi> This is the Living Prayer of the Living Child, which con&#x17F;i&#x17F;ts not in a Form of Words, either read out of a Book or conceived in the Mind; but in feeling the Breath of its Nature i&#x17F;&#x17F;uing out, from the Principle of Life in it, to the Living Spring, which is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it; who by cau&#x17F;ing his vertues to &#x17F;pring up in it, nouri&#x17F;h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to Everla&#x17F;ting Life.</p>
        <p>But now, man who is not born of the Spirit, but (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving &#x17F;ome of the Truths of God in the Wi&#x17F;dom from below) hath attained to &#x17F;ome change of Opinion and Conver&#x17F;ation, he pretends to be this Birth from above, though indeed he is born but <hi>of Bloods,</hi> or <hi>of the Will of the fle&#x17F;h,</hi> or <hi>of the Will of Man, John</hi> 1.13. and what God begets in, and gives to his True Child, he will be imitating, though he be out of the Nature and Spirit, where the True Child is begotten, and where the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45699:5"/> True gift of the Father is received by him. He will be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though he hath not received any Proportion of the Living Faith from the Hand of the Father; he will be forming Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Sorrow for &#x17F;in, though his Heart be not turned from it; he will be hoping in Gods Mercy, although he be both from off the Foundation, and from under the &#x17F;hadow of the Mercy-&#x17F;eat; and he will be praying, though he hath neither received the Spirit, nor be taught by the Spirit to pray: And &#x17F;o being from that which &#x17F;hould guide him, and teach him the truth and way of Wor&#x17F;hip as it is in Je&#x17F;us, he runs out into the inventions and imaginations, and &#x17F;ets up a way of his own chu&#x17F;ing; which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving much con&#x17F;idered of, and beat out by rea&#x17F;onings, and fenced about with Arguments, he grows wi&#x17F;e in his own eyes, and now verily believes it to be the way of God, and that he is able to maintain it again&#x17F;t all oppo&#x17F;ers. Thus one man, he is for a Form; another man, he is again&#x17F;t a Form, and for conceived prayers; and each think them&#x17F;elves able to maintain their own, and to overthrow each other. But Oh that that ear were open, which can hear the truth, that where there is any true, hone&#x17F;t, upright de&#x17F;ire after God, from the &#x17F;implicity of the heart, it might not be thus betrayed through the &#x17F;ubtilty of the fle&#x17F;hly wi&#x17F;dom, which lies lurking in the wi&#x17F;e, rea&#x17F;oning, knowing part, to betray the poor weak Babe. The natural man, the rea&#x17F;oning man, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der&#x17F;tanding man, the wi&#x17F;e man according to the natural wi&#x17F;dom, cannot under&#x17F;tand the things of God. Here's no learning to pray aright, to believe aright, to hope aright, to mourn aright, to rejoyce aright, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this wi&#x17F;dom mu&#x17F;t be brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19.) and a man mu&#x17F;t become as a child to all knowledge, as let in this way: And he that &#x17F;o becomes a child, is taught to pray, to believe, to wait, to hope, and all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce&#x17F;&#x17F;ary to eternal life.</p>
        <p>Now as the Father teacheth to pray, &#x17F;o he giveth de&#x17F;ires or words (if he plea&#x17F;e) according to the pre&#x17F;ent need. Sometimes he gives but ability to &#x17F;igh, or groan (if he give no more, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that.) Sometimes he gives &#x17F;trong breathings, and plenty of words to pour out the &#x17F;oul in before the Lord. But if a man &#x17F;hould catch tho&#x17F;e words, and lay them up again&#x17F;t another time, and offer them up to God in his own will, this would be but Will-wor&#x17F;hip <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45699:6"/> and abomination. This I have known experimentally, and have &#x17F;elt the Wrath of God for it. That is Prayer, which comes fre&#x17F;h from the Spirit; and that is a true de&#x17F;ire, which the Spirit begets: but the affections and &#x17F;parks of mans kindling plea&#x17F;e not the Lord, nor do they conduce to the Souls re&#x17F;t, but will end in the Bed of &#x17F;orrow,
<hi>I&#x17F;a.</hi> 50.11.</p>
        <p>Now as touching the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> or Prayers conceived without the immediate breathings of the Spirit, I &#x17F;hall &#x17F;peak mine own experience faithfully, which is this: I have felt both the&#x17F;e wayes draw out the wrong part, and keep that alive in me, which the true Prayer kills. And he that ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a word, beyond the &#x17F;ence which God begets in his &#x17F;pirit, takes God's Name in vain, and provokes him to jealou&#x17F;ie again&#x17F;t his own &#x17F;oul. <hi>God is in Heaven, thou art on Earth, therefore let thy words be few.</hi> The few words which the Spirit &#x17F;peaks, or the few, &#x17F;till; &#x17F;oft, gentle breathings which the Spirit begets, are plea&#x17F;ing to God, and profitable to the Soul: but the many words, which mans wi&#x17F;dom affects, hurt the precious life, and thicken the vail of death over the Soul, keeping that part alive, which &#x17F;eparates from God; which part mu&#x17F;t dye, e're the Soul can live.</p>
        <p>The true Prayer is by that which God begets, in the vertue of his Spirit (<hi>praying alwayes in the Spirit,</hi> Ephe&#x17F;. 6.18. Jude 20.) in the time he chu&#x17F;es: for the Spirit breatheth as well when he li&#x17F;teth, as where he li&#x17F;teth; and man cannot limit him when he &#x17F;hall breath, or when he &#x17F;hall not breath, but is to wait the &#x17F;ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ons of his breathing, and &#x17F;o to <hi>watch unto Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
        <p>Now if the Prayer be in words (for there is a praying without words) then it mu&#x17F;t be in tho&#x17F;e words which he plea&#x17F;eth to give, from the &#x17F;ence which he kindleth, and not in the words which mans wi&#x17F;dom teacheth, or would chu&#x17F;e to u&#x17F;e. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the true Religion, and in every exerci&#x17F;e of it, mans wi&#x17F;dom is kept out, and nail'd to the Cro&#x17F;s, by which means the immortal life is rai&#x17F;ed and grows in the true Di&#x17F;ciple. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, he hopes, he waits, he prayes, he mourns, he rejoyces, he obeyes, &amp;c. in the Cro&#x17F;s to the mortal part: not as mans wi&#x17F;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom teacheth, or would teach, or can teach any of the&#x17F;e things; for his Sacrifice is &#x17F;till an abomination, even to the wi&#x17F;e <hi>Egyptian</hi> 
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45699:6"/> part in him&#x17F;elf (O wi&#x17F;e man, aba&#x17F;e thy &#x17F;elf before the Lord in his Spirit, that thou maye&#x17F;t read this and live) but as the life teacheth, as the Wi&#x17F;dom from above teacheth, which breaketh down, &#x17F;hutteth up, confoundeth and de&#x17F;troyeth mans wi&#x17F;dom, while he is teaching his Babe.</p>
        <p>Thus have I an&#x17F;wered, in the &#x17F;implicity of my heart, to the nature of the thing, &#x17F;o far as the Lord hath plea&#x17F;ed to draw forth my &#x17F;pirit; and in &#x17F;inking down to that, which thus opened my &#x17F;pirit, my An&#x17F;wer may ea&#x17F;ily be read and a&#x17F;&#x17F;ented to: but to that which is in the di&#x17F;puting wi&#x17F;dom, out of the feeling of the hidden life and vertue, it may prove a My&#x17F;tery.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, he al&#x17F;o intreateth me to peru&#x17F;e &#x17F;eriou&#x17F;ly, and to lay deeply to heart (in the real fear and dread of the great God) &#x17F;ome particulars which he teacheth for Truths.</p>
        <p>I perceive he is offended at the que&#x17F;tioning of his Mini&#x17F;try, and that the main intent of his propo&#x17F;ing the&#x17F;e, is to ju&#x17F;tifie his Mini&#x17F;try; which if they were true, yet the preaching of them would not prove him, or any man el&#x17F;e, to be a Mini&#x17F;ter of Je&#x17F;us Chri&#x17F;t: for it is not preaching things that are true, which makes a true Mini&#x17F;ter, but the receiving of his Mini&#x17F;try from the Lord. The Go&#x17F;pel is the Lords, which is to be preached, and it is to be preached in his Power; and the Mini&#x17F;ters which preach it, are to be endued with his Power, and to be &#x17F;ent by him. The Apo&#x17F;tles them&#x17F;elves, though they had received in&#x17F;tructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdom from Chri&#x17F;ts own lips, both in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and after his Re&#x17F;urrection (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.3.) and had received a Commi&#x17F;&#x17F;ion from him to teach all Nations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19. Yet this was not &#x17F;ufficient to make them able Mini&#x17F;ters of the New Te&#x17F;tament; but before they went abroad to Preach, they were to wait for the Power, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4, 8. And when they had received it, they were to mini&#x17F;ter in it, that men might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Power and by the Power, that the Faith of per&#x17F;ons might not &#x17F;tand in the wi&#x17F;dom of their words (which <hi>Paul</hi> might have abounded in, as well as others) <hi>but in the Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.5. And this was it made <hi>Paul</hi> mini&#x17F;ter in fear and trembling,, le&#x17F;t the wrong part in him &#x17F;hould mini&#x17F;ter, le&#x17F;t the earthly under&#x17F;tanding part &#x17F;hould be holding forth the Truths of God out of the Life, out of the Power; and &#x17F;o he &#x17F;hould <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45699:7"/> Convert men to the Wi&#x17F;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters"><desc>&#x2022;&#x2022;</desc></gap>m of the words he &#x17F;pake, and not to the Power, v. 2, 3. This was it he was &#x17F;ent for, to turn men <hi>from darkne&#x17F;s to light, from the Power of Satan to God</hi> (Acts 26.18.) from the &#x17F;pirit of enmity and death to the Spirit of Love and Life: and this he was careful of in his Mini&#x17F;try, that men might not run away with his words and mi&#x17F;s of the thing. And this al&#x17F;o was the way whereby he di&#x17F;covered true and fal&#x17F;e Mini&#x17F;ters, <hi>I will come and know</hi> (&#x17F;aith he) <hi>not the &#x17F;peech of them which are puffed up, but the Power: for the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in Power,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.19, 20. Many men might catch their words, and run away with them and Preach them, but they could not Mini&#x17F;ter in the Power. Now the Kingdome, which the Go&#x17F;pel-Mini&#x17F;ters are the Preachers of, con&#x17F;i&#x17F;ts not in words, but in Power. <hi>God hath made us able Mini&#x17F;ters of the New Te&#x17F;tament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit,</hi>
2 Cor. 3.6. The Mini&#x17F;try of the New Te&#x17F;tament is a Mini&#x17F;try of the Spirit, and it cannot be without the Spirit. It is a reaching to men's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ciences <hi>in the demon&#x17F;tration of the Spirit and of Power</hi> (1 Cor. 2.4. and 2 Cor. 4.1, 2.) which being felt in the heart and turned to, this converts them to God.</p>
        <p>The Mini&#x17F;try of the Go&#x17F;pel doth not con&#x17F;i&#x17F;t in a bare opening of the Letter (or rai&#x17F;ing of Doctrines and U&#x17F;es from the Letter, which the wi&#x17F;dom of man may ea&#x17F;ily perform) as the Mini&#x17F;try of the Law did: but in bringing men to the feeling of the Spirit, even of the Eternal Power of God which redeems, in turning men from the darkne&#x17F;s to the Light, in &#x17F;etting their faces towards the Power. The Go&#x17F;pel is the &#x17F;ub&#x17F;tance of what was &#x17F;hadowed out in the Law; and he that Mini&#x17F;ters it, mu&#x17F;t Mini&#x17F;ter &#x17F;ub&#x17F;tance. He mu&#x17F;t have the <hi>heavenly Trea&#x17F;ure</hi> (that's the &#x17F;ub&#x17F;tance) in his earthen ve&#x17F;&#x17F;el, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. and he mu&#x17F;t give out of this Trea&#x17F;ure into the ve&#x17F;&#x17F;el which God prepares: and that he may do this, he mu&#x17F;t Mini&#x17F;ter in the Spirit and in the Power. His words mu&#x17F;t not be &#x17F;uch as mans wi&#x17F;dom would teach, or as mans comprehen&#x17F;ion would gather, but &#x17F;uch words as Gods Wi&#x17F;dom prepares for him, and puts into his mouth. He that will be a true Mini&#x17F;ter, mu&#x17F;t receive both his gift, his Mini&#x17F;try, and the exerci&#x17F;e of both from the Lord; and mu&#x17F;t be &#x17F;ure in his mini&#x17F;tring to keep in the Power, or he will never
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45699:7"/> win others to the Power: but in keeping in the Power, while he is mini&#x17F;tring, and &#x17F;tanding in the cro&#x17F;s to his own under&#x17F;tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and wi&#x17F;dom, giving forth the truths which the Lord chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;eth to have him &#x17F;peak, in the words which God chu&#x17F;eth, even in the words which are mini&#x17F;tred to him by the Power; in thus mini&#x17F;tring he &#x17F;hall &#x17F;ave both his own Soul and tho&#x17F;e that hear him, even all who in fear and meekne&#x17F;s receive the ingrafted Word, which is able to &#x17F;ave the Soul. For alas, alas, many have received words of Truth, and apprehen&#x17F;ions of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whereby they hope to be &#x17F;aved: but how few are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that Knowledge which &#x17F;tands in the Power, which alone converts and keeps alive unto God! O how many Souls are to be an&#x17F;wered for by them, who take upon them to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;tors from God, who have fed the Flock with words, with
<hi>Di&#x17F;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour&#x17F;es which they have made,</hi> and have ruled over them
<hi>with force and cruelty,</hi> but have wanted the love, the tenderne&#x17F;s, the Light and Power of the true Shepherd! O what will the&#x17F;e do, when God requires his &#x17F;heep at their hands! O that there were an heart to con&#x17F;ider. Ye Shepherds of <hi>England,</hi> little do ye know what is towards you.</p>
        <p>Now for tho&#x17F;e things them&#x17F;elves, which he &#x17F;aith, he
<hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally endeavours to make known to the &#x17F;ons of men,</hi> there is a mixture in them; which, if he could &#x17F;ingly apply him&#x17F;elf to wait of the Lord, in the meek &#x17F;ober Spirit, out of the con&#x17F;ultations, wi&#x17F;dom and confidence of the fle&#x17F;h, it might plea&#x17F;e the Lord to make manife&#x17F;t to him.</p>
        <p>The fir&#x17F;t particular of tho&#x17F;e, which he layes down for Truths, is, <hi>That the good things of this life, honours, riches,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>unle&#x17F;s we make u&#x17F;e of them in the &#x17F;ervice of God, are but vanity, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of &#x17F;pirit; And in no wi&#x17F;e any more capable to &#x17F;atisfie, or content an immortal Soul, than Lime, and A&#x17F;hes, and Cobwebs, and &#x17F;uch like tra&#x17F;h are to &#x17F;atisfie, and keep in health the bodies of tho&#x17F;e per&#x17F;ons, who through the depravedne&#x17F;s of their appetite, de&#x17F;ire to feed on them.</hi>
            </p>
        <p><hi>An&#x17F;w.</hi> Chri&#x17F;t by his Mini&#x17F;try, calleth his Di&#x17F;ciples out of the world, up to the Father, out of the honours, riches and what ever el&#x17F;e is of the world. <hi>How can ye believe, which receive ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one of another, and &#x17F;eek not the honour that cometh from God
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45699:8"/> onely?</hi> John 5.44. And the rich man, he bids him
<hi>&#x17F;ell all and follow him.</hi> And the Apo&#x17F;tle <hi>John</hi> &#x17F;aith,
<hi>Love not the world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the ju&#x17F;t of the fle&#x17F;h, the lu&#x17F;t of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world,</hi> 1 John 2.15, 16. He that will be a Di&#x17F;ciple of Chri&#x17F;t, mu&#x17F;t travel out of the earthly into the heavenly, leaving all that is of this world behind him, po&#x17F;&#x17F;e&#x17F;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ing nothing as his portion, but him who hath call'd him out of his Countrey, from among his kindred, and from his Father's hou&#x17F;e to another Land, kindred and habitation. So that here they are Pilgrims and Strangers, Sojourners and Pa&#x17F;&#x17F;engers, unknown to the world and of a &#x17F;trange garb, behaviour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in it, not enjoying any thing as the world enjoyes, not u&#x17F;ing any thing as the world u&#x17F;eth, not honouring men or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving honour from men, as the world gives or receives honour, but honouring men in the Lord, and receiving honour from the Lord: and what ever they &#x17F;eem to retain of the earthly things, they hold as Stewards under the Lord, not u&#x17F;ing or di&#x17F;po&#x17F;ing of them as they think good, but waiting for the di&#x17F;covery of the Ma&#x17F;ters plea&#x17F;ure, who is to order, in his Coun&#x17F;el and Wi&#x17F;dom, all that is his own to his own glory. The Law required a tenth part to be given up to the Lord: the Go&#x17F;pel requires all; <hi>Soul, Body, Spirit, Goods, good Name,</hi> &amp;c. even that the whole po&#x17F;&#x17F;e&#x17F;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ion be &#x17F;old and laid at the Ma&#x17F;ters feet: and he that keepeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing back, cannot be a Di&#x17F;ciple, cannot be a Souldier of Chri&#x17F;t, but mu&#x17F;t needs <hi>entangle him&#x17F;elf with the affairs of this life.</hi> This is &#x17F;ound and &#x17F;avoury, even the Truth of Je&#x17F;us, as it is known and felt in the renewed Spirit: but his Words, if he mea&#x17F;ure them in the pure Light of God, he will perceive not to have &#x17F;prung thence, but to have been formed in the earthly wi&#x17F;e part, even in that wi&#x17F;dom, under&#x17F;tanding and comprehen&#x17F;ion, which is &#x17F;hut out of the My&#x17F;teries of Gods Kingdom.</p>
        <p>For his &#x17F;econd, <hi>That nothing but the enjoyment of God, the Fountain of all Goodne&#x17F;s, can truly and really content an immortal Soul:</hi> And for his third, <hi>That no man can enjoy God, but he that loves him with all his heart, and with all his Soul, and (for his &#x17F;ake) his Neighbour as him&#x17F;elf:</hi> I own both the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;elves <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45699:8"/> and the&#x17F;e words, and I felt a good &#x17F;avour in them at the reading of them: onely let me &#x17F;ay this, if he put men upon &#x17F;triving after the&#x17F;e things, without pointing them to the gift where the &#x17F;trength is received to perform, and where the wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be for the &#x17F;trength, he cannot preach them profitably to his hearers.</p>
        <p>To his fourth, <hi>That, though every &#x17F;incere Convert, or regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate per&#x17F;on loves God continually with his whole heart, as to the habit, or root of holy love; yet whil&#x17F;t he is in the body, he may &#x17F;ometimes fail of the Act, or fruit of it, and may offend God through the love of the creature. Which Truth (&#x17F;o much oppo&#x17F;ed in the&#x17F;e dayes) is clear, and manife&#x17F;t in the holy Scriptures: particularly in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the hainous &#x17F;ins of the Prophet David, and Peter the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;tle.</hi>
            </p>
        <p><hi>An&#x17F;w.</hi> The Lord <hi>Circumci&#x17F;eth the heart</hi> of Believers under the New Covenant, <hi>to love the Lord their God with all their heart, that they may live: he cau&#x17F;eth the Plant to &#x17F;pring up out of the dry and barren ground, which he watereth with his Ble&#x17F;&#x17F;ing; and he layeth his Axe to the Root of the old Tree, hewing at it, even till he hath cut it up: he engrafteth the Eternal Word into the heart, and by it is daily purifying thereof, fulfilling the good plea&#x17F;ure of his goodne&#x17F;s therein, and carrying on the Work of Faith with power:</hi> and the Mini&#x17F;try which he gave, was for the <hi>perfecting of the Saints.</hi> (Ephe&#x17F;. 4.12, 13.) which Mini&#x17F;try exhorted and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Believers (from God's Promi&#x17F;es of his pre&#x17F;ence and powerful operation of his Spirit in the hearts of his Sons and Daughters) to
<hi>clean&#x17F;e them&#x17F;elves from all filthine&#x17F;s of the fle&#x17F;h and &#x17F;pirit, perfecting holine&#x17F;s in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. Now that the corrupt Tree &#x17F;hall never be cut down whil&#x17F;t man is in the body, that the heart &#x17F;hall never be throughly circumci&#x17F;ed to love the Lord, but be in danger of
<hi>offending God through the love of the Creature:</hi> this doctrine and belief &#x17F;pringeth not from the pure Fountain of Life and Power, but the rea&#x17F;oning part hath gathered it from it's conceivings beneath the Power.</p>
        <p>The Seed of God cannot &#x17F;in (for as he is pure which begetteth, &#x17F;o is that pure which is begotten of him) nor can man &#x17F;in, who is born of it and abides in it: and if God plea&#x17F;e to perfect the Birth and the work of Circumci&#x17F;ion, What can hinder a man <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45699:9"/> from being wholly born of it &amp; from abiding in it? Indeed a man that &#x17F;trives in his own &#x17F;trength, either again&#x17F;t &#x17F;in or towards ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line&#x17F;s, may well doubt of ever having it accompli&#x17F;hed: but he that feels the Eternal Power beginning the work, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on daily, cannot doubt but he can perfect it, yea, and is encouraged (by the feeling thereof) to hope and wait on him for the perfecting of it.</p>
        <p>As for his in&#x17F;tances of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> they reach not the thing: For though <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did fall, yet both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> might attain an higher &#x17F;tate before they went out of the body, then they were in before they fell. <hi>David</hi> was a great Prophet, and <hi>Peter</hi> a pretious Di&#x17F;ciple, but yet there was an higher E&#x17F;tate to be admini&#x17F;tred, even the receiving that which the Prophets prophe&#x17F;ied of, and which the Di&#x17F;ciple was to wait for. The Di&#x17F;ciples who had known Chri&#x17F;t, and had been taught by him, and had received a Commi&#x17F;&#x17F;ion from him, to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth was given, yet were to wait for a Further and Higher State, even for receiving
<hi>the Promi&#x17F;e of the Father, the Power from on High,</hi> that he that was with them might be in them, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>John</hi> was as great as any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and yet he that was lea&#x17F;t in the Kingdom, was greater then he. Read the Acts of the Apo&#x17F;tles, behold what a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people was brought forth, even in the beginning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po&#x17F;tles Mini&#x17F;try, how full of Faith, how &#x17F;tripped of the world, how &#x17F;ingle-hearted to God and one towards another, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) What would the&#x17F;e be, abiding and growing up in the Vine? The cutting off of &#x17F;in, is nece&#x17F;&#x17F;ary while in the Body, but to make the committing of &#x17F;in nece&#x17F;&#x17F;ary while in the Body, is a great Derogation to the Power of Gods Grace, and to the <hi>My&#x17F;tery of Faith,</hi> which overcometh the evils of the Heart, and the Worldly Nature within; purifieth the Con&#x17F;cience from dead works, and is <hi>held in the Pure Con&#x17F;cience.</hi> O that men knew the Power, and the Faith which &#x17F;tands in the Power: For then would not they judge it &#x17F;o impo&#x17F;&#x17F;ible to be clean&#x17F;ed by the Faith through the Power. O that Light, that Light, that Pure Light of the Spirit, wherein the Living Blood runs, which clean&#x17F;eth from all &#x17F;in, and keepeth clean them that abide and walk in it! If this were but a little felt, &#x17F;uch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45699:9"/> as the&#x17F;e (which are gathered in the comprehen&#x17F;ion from words read, without being let into the thing it &#x17F;elf) would &#x17F;oon vani&#x17F;h, and find no place in the Heart where the Power dwells, nor in the under&#x17F;tanding which is renewed, pre&#x17F;erved and fed by the Power. For the things of God are to be known, and held in the under&#x17F;tanding which is given of God (which under&#x17F;tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of the Spirit, and is Spiritual) and not wirh the natural under&#x17F;tanding, which cannot receive the things of the Spirit, but onely a carnal apprehen&#x17F;ion and &#x17F;ence of the words of the Spirit, according as a man can beat them out with, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them in his rea&#x17F;oning part.</p>
        <p>To the fifth, <hi>That the Souls of the faithful are alwayes growing in grace, whil&#x17F;t they are in the body; and at the in&#x17F;tant of death, or &#x17F;eparation from the body, our Lord Je&#x17F;us &#x17F;hall pre&#x17F;ent them to the Father without &#x17F;pot, or blemi&#x17F;h.</hi>
            </p>
        <p><hi>An&#x17F;w.</hi> Chri&#x17F;t pre&#x17F;enteth to the Father, when he hath purified the heart and mind, and made it fit for Gods pure life and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ence. He hath received the fulne&#x17F;s from the Father, and hath freely given of his grace and of his truth to the &#x17F;ons of men, to regenerate them, to clean&#x17F;e and &#x17F;anctifie their hearts, and make them fit for God to dwell in. He &#x17F;itteth in his Temple as <hi>a Refiner and Purifier of Silver</hi> (who is like <hi>a Refiner's Fire and like Fuller's Soap</hi>) and when he hath purified his Di&#x17F;ciples, his Children, his Levites, he pre&#x17F;enteth them to the Lord, for the Lord to Tabernacle and dwell in: when he hath throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ecrated them, he pre&#x17F;enteth them as Kings and Prie&#x17F;ts to his Father, to offer up <hi>an Offering for Righteou&#x17F;ne&#x17F;s,</hi> and to reign with him in his Kingdom, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. And there were &#x17F;ome &#x17F;o purified by the leaven of the Kingdom (which purgeth out the old leaven by degrees, even till at length it hath made the lump wholly new) that to them all things were pure, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. There were &#x17F;ome <hi>come unto Mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Jeru&#x17F;alem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the general A&#x17F;&#x17F;embly and Church of the fir&#x17F;t-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of ju&#x17F;t men, made perfect, and to Je&#x17F;us the Moderator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.22, 23, 24. Thus it was before the Apo&#x17F;tacy: yea, <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45699:10"/> and after the Apo&#x17F;tacy there were &#x17F;ome found &#x17F;tanding on <hi>Mount Sion</hi> again, &#x17F;uch as had learned the <hi>New Song,</hi> &#x17F;uch as <hi>were redeemed from the Earth,</hi> &#x17F;uch as <hi>were not defiled with Women,</hi> (with any of the fal&#x17F;e Churches or their fal&#x17F;e wayes of wor&#x17F;hip) but had kept their Virginity in the Wilderne&#x17F;s. If ye would know who the&#x17F;e were, they were the
<hi>fir&#x17F;t-fruits unto God and the Lamb</hi> after the Apo&#x17F;tacy, who were throughly clean&#x17F;ed by the Spirit of burning, in&#x17F;omuch as <hi>in their mouth was found no guile,</hi> but <hi>they were without fault before the Throne of God,</hi> Revel. 14. v. 1. to 6.</p>
        <p>The Work of the Spirit of Chri&#x17F;t in the heart is an inward work, and doth not con&#x17F;i&#x17F;t in outward time or &#x17F;ea&#x17F;ons, but in &#x17F;piritual degrees and &#x17F;ea&#x17F;ons: which when they are fini&#x17F;hed, the heart renewed, the &#x17F;pirit changed, the work wrought out; then the glory of the Father is revealed, the entrance into the everla&#x17F;ting Kingdom Mini&#x17F;tred, and then there is a &#x17F;itting down in the everla&#x17F;ting Man&#x17F;ion, even with Chri&#x17F;t in the Heavenly places which he hath prepared, where they that are redeemed, and purged, and &#x17F;anctified, &#x17F;it together with him: and as the body cannot hinder his entring into the &#x17F;pirits of his Saints, and his dwelling in them, no more can it hinder their entring into him and dwelling in him.</p>
        <p>Now there are &#x17F;everal exerci&#x17F;es of Spirit, &#x17F;everal mea&#x17F;ures of Faith, and &#x17F;everal degrees of Life and Glory. Some are under the Clouds, &#x17F;ome in the Sea; &#x17F;ome in <hi>Egypt,</hi> &#x17F;ome in the Wilderne&#x17F;s; &#x17F;ome waiting for his appearance, &#x17F;ome in the enjoyment of him already appeared. In &#x17F;ome the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, of Sanctification, of newne&#x17F;s of Spirit and Life is but begun, in others it is interrupted and they come to a lo&#x17F;&#x17F;e; in &#x17F;ome it is much carried on, even towards con&#x17F;ummation, and &#x17F;ome are already <hi>compleat in him,</hi> finding fulne&#x17F;s of &#x17F;atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in him (in whom the everla&#x17F;ting Springs are opened, to the full content of their hearts) and bring forth fruit to him, to the full content and &#x17F;atisfaction of his heart. In the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;tles dayes there were tho&#x17F;e that waited for his coming, and there were tho&#x17F;e al&#x17F;o that knew him come, and had received the good under&#x17F;tanding from him, and were <hi>in the Eternal life,</hi> John 5.20.</p>
        <p><pb n="17" facs="tcp:45699:10"/>Yet this doth not exclude growth, for the fulne&#x17F;s is infinite: and though a perfect &#x17F;tate may be attained in the perfect gift, yet there is a growth in the perfection (for Chri&#x17F;t who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and in whom was no guile, grew in Wi&#x17F;dom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in favour with God and men.) And as God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, &#x17F;o that which is tran&#x17F;planted into him, there is no growth in him; but the Tree, which &#x17F;tands in God's holy Earth, by his pure River of waters, &#x17F;hall grow for ever into his endle&#x17F;s life and fulne&#x17F;s.</p>
        <p>To his &#x17F;ixth, <hi>That no man can &#x17F;o know God as to love him with all his heart, and with all his Soul, but through the knowledge of Je&#x17F;us Chri&#x17F;t, and him Crucified: Who, by tho&#x17F;e grievous &#x17F;ufferings which he endur'd when he was upon Earth, made &#x17F;atisfaction to the ju&#x17F;tice of God for the &#x17F;ins of all tho&#x17F;e that believe in his Name: &#x17F;o that it is as con&#x17F;i&#x17F;tent with the ju&#x17F;tice, as with the mercy of God, to forgive them their &#x17F;ins, and make them heirs of eternal life. God is ju&#x17F;t, and the Ju&#x17F;tifier of him that believeth in Je&#x17F;us.</hi>
            </p>
        <p><hi>An&#x17F;w.</hi> The knowledge of Chri&#x17F;t is life Eternal, and in his Cro&#x17F;s is the &#x17F;piritual vertue, which cuts off the uncircumci&#x17F;ion of the heart, whereby it is enabled to love the Lord. Now <hi>Chri&#x17F;t</hi> is
<hi>the Lord from Heaven, the quickning Spirit,</hi> who &#x17F;ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Seed of the Kingdom in the heart, and cau&#x17F;eth it to &#x17F;pring up; out of which Seed the Faith, the Love, the Hope, the Meekne&#x17F;s, the Patience, and every &#x17F;piritual fruit &#x17F;prings and grows. And he that is thus born of this Seed, and receives the knowledge of life which &#x17F;prings from this Seed, he cannot but love him which begat him, and he reapeth the fruit of all that Chri&#x17F;t did and &#x17F;uffered in that prepared body: and God is both ju&#x17F;t, and the Ju&#x17F;tifier of him, who is thus united to Je&#x17F;us. But that man who knoweth not this Faith, nor is acquainted with the love which &#x17F;pringeth from this Root, and which is of this Divine nature, but thinketh to be ju&#x17F;tified by applying to him&#x17F;elf what is related in the Hi&#x17F;tories concerning Chri&#x17F;t; this man deceives his Soul, and mi&#x17F;&#x17F;eth of the true Ju&#x17F;tification: for God is ju&#x17F;t, who hath made the Promi&#x17F;e &#x17F;ure to the Seed, and hath &#x17F;hut out man, further than he is born of the Seed, and found in the Seed. But he who abideth in the Seed, and in whom the Seed findeth plea&#x17F;ure and abideth, he cannot mi&#x17F;s of <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45699:11"/> the Promi&#x17F;e, of the everla&#x17F;ting Righteou&#x17F;ne&#x17F;s, the Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Peace, the Joy, and whatever el&#x17F;e God giveth to the Seed.</p>
        <p>To his &#x17F;eventh and la&#x17F;t, <hi>That the ready way to receive Chri&#x17F;t, the onely Light, by which we may &#x17F;ee the way to Heaven: or &#x17F;o to believe in him that we may be &#x17F;aved by him, is, to for&#x17F;ake all that we have, that we may be his Di&#x17F;ciples: that is to &#x17F;ay, to take off our affections from things on the Earth, and to &#x17F;et them on things above, where Je&#x17F;us &#x17F;itteth on the right hand of God: putting our tru&#x17F;t and confidence in the free, and in the infinite mercy of God, through Chri&#x17F;t, to be guided by him in all our wayes, to be led by his good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in all tho&#x17F;e wayes of grace and holine&#x17F;s, through which we mu&#x17F;t pa&#x17F;s before we can attain to glory.</hi>
            </p>
        <p><hi>An&#x17F;w.</hi> To know Chri&#x17F;t as the Light eternal, (as he was ye&#x17F;ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, is to day, and will be for ever) to tru&#x17F;t this Light in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, calls, and free openings of love, to feel its living vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and in that virtue to give up all thats of the earthly nature and &#x17F;pirit, to &#x17F;ell it for the everla&#x17F;ting inheritance, this is indeed the way to life. But it is not the doing of things which is of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, for man may imitate and &#x17F;trive to do much, and may go a great way <hi>in for&#x17F;aking all, and in taking off his affections from things,</hi> (ina&#x17F;much as he may give all his goods to the poor, and his body to be burned, and yet it profit him nothing:) but it is the doing of things in the virtue, in the life, in the power which comes from Chri&#x17F;t, which is of acceptance with God, and of advantage to the &#x17F;oul. Every motion and operation of true life &#x17F;prings from the root of life, and hath the virtue of the root in it: and that which differenceth it from all mens imitations, and from all the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne&#x17F;&#x17F;es which the earthly &#x17F;pirit can frame, is the nature and virtue of the root being found in it. Therefore he that will be a true Chri&#x17F;tian, mu&#x17F;t eye Chri&#x17F;t the &#x17F;pring of his life, and keep in the feeling of his living virtue, and in that offer up all his Sacrifices of faith, love, and obedience to God: and he that will be a true Mini&#x17F;ter, mu&#x17F;t wait upon the power him&#x17F;elf, to be an In&#x17F;trument (in the hand of the power) to direct men to this, and to pre&#x17F;erve and build them up therein.</p>
        <p>But alas, this is the Stone, which the wi&#x17F;e Builders have all along refu&#x17F;ed! The Builders before the coming of Chri&#x17F;t, they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45699:11"/> got a knowledge concerning the <hi>Me&#x17F;&#x17F;iah</hi> to come, but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the thing it &#x17F;elf, rejected both it at its coming, and al&#x17F;o the Ve&#x17F;&#x17F;el wherein it appeared. And the Builders all along the Apo&#x17F;tacy, gat a knowledge of Chri&#x17F;t come, and preached Believing in him crucified as the way to life; but the living Stone, the living thing it &#x17F;elf (which is both the foundation, the corner-Stone, and the top Stone of the Building) they have been ignorant of, and ready to per&#x17F;ecute every appearance of it. Chri&#x17F;t can no more now appear in Spirit, than formerly he could in that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red body of fle&#x17F;h; but the wi&#x17F;e Builders now are as ready to cry out again&#x17F;t him for a Bla&#x17F;phemer, a prophaner of Gods Ordinances, a deceiver of the people (yea, a Witch or one that hath a Devil) as the wi&#x17F;e Builders then were. <hi>But Wi&#x17F;dom</hi> in all ages <hi>is ju&#x17F;ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by her Children,</hi> and of none el&#x17F;e. He that is born of the Wi&#x17F;dom, he can di&#x17F;cern the womb, and own the fruit and branchings forth thereof under the mean dark vail, whereby it hides it &#x17F;elf from all the fle&#x17F;hly wi&#x17F;e of every age. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God cometh not by ob&#x17F;ervation,</hi> the wi&#x17F;e&#x17F;t Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri&#x17F;ees could not know it by all the ob&#x17F;ervations, which they could gather out of <hi>Mo&#x17F;es</hi> and the Prophets Writings; nor can any now know it, by any ob&#x17F;ervations they can gather out of the Apo&#x17F;tles Writings: but by being born of that &#x17F;pirit whereof they were born, and by being formed in that womb wherein they were formed, by this means alone is the thing come to be known which they knew. He that receiveth the &#x17F;ame eye, &#x17F;eeth the &#x17F;ame thing, according to his mea&#x17F;ure: and coming to the life, wherein they received the Truth, the words which they &#x17F;pake concerning the Truth are ea&#x17F;ie. Thus as they were writ in the Spirit, &#x17F;o are they there along truly read: and being &#x17F;o read, they become exceeding profitable to that which &#x17F;o reads them: but man gue&#x17F;&#x17F;ing, and imagining, and rea&#x17F;oning in his carnal wi&#x17F;dom concerning the things of God, and &#x17F;o gathering &#x17F;ences and meanings about the words and expre&#x17F;&#x17F;ions of Scripture, doth but build up a <hi>Babel,</hi> which the eternal Life and Power will throw down (when ever he appears) with that which built it. O that men were wi&#x17F;e to wait for the di&#x17F;covery of the true Rock, and of the true Builder upon that Rock, that that City and Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding might be rai&#x17F;ed in them, which God alone can rear, that <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45699:12"/> they might not be left de&#x17F;olate and mi&#x17F;erable in that &#x17F;tormy day, which will &#x17F;hake all Buildings, and Foundations, and Rocks but our Rock: wherein all Profe&#x17F;&#x17F;ors, and Preachers, and high Notioni&#x17F;ts, and what ever &#x17F;ort el&#x17F;e can be named (who have &#x17F;tumbled at Gods living Truth, and at the pure appearance of his redeeming Power, which in this age hath mightily broke forth, after the long dark night of Apo&#x17F;tacy, to the &#x17F;ight of every eye which is opened in the Spirit) &#x17F;hall confe&#x17F;s with tears, &#x17F;orrow, angui&#x17F;h and &#x17F;hame, that <hi>their Rock is not in our Rock, they them&#x17F;elves being Judges.</hi> For though all &#x17F;ort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe&#x17F;&#x17F;ors generally own Chri&#x17F;t as the Rock in words, yet mo&#x17F;t mi&#x17F;s of the thing: and the &#x17F;ubtile Enemy hath made u&#x17F;e of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or apprehen&#x17F;ion of the thing in the carnal mind, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them of the thing, to keep them from feeling the eternal vertue, the living Power of Life in the heart, which is the Arm of Gods Salvation, whereby Chri&#x17F;t draws mans lo&#x17F;t &#x17F;oul and &#x17F;pirit out of the Pit, out of the Grave, out of Sin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption up to the Father. But O how are poor hearts deceived, who think by a believing of what Chri&#x17F;t did, of a &#x17F;atisfaction he made for them while he was here on Earth, though they lye in the Pit all their dayes, though they carry the body of &#x17F;in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with them to the very la&#x17F;t of their time here in the body, and have not felt the Arm of God's Power breaking down their &#x17F;piritual enemies, their lu&#x17F;ts, their corruptions, and redeeming them from them, yet hope to be &#x17F;aved in the end, and to be pre&#x17F;ented without &#x17F;pot or wrinkle to God! Chri&#x17F;t had the name
<hi>Je&#x17F;us</hi> given him, becau&#x17F;e he was to &#x17F;ave his People from their &#x17F;in: and no man can truly and livingly know the name <hi>Je&#x17F;us,</hi> further than he feels the &#x17F;aving vertue of it: but he that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually feels the vertue, he indeed knows the name, and can bow at the name, feeling his lu&#x17F;ts and enemies bowed under by the power thereof, and that rai&#x17F;ed up in him, which can Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;hip the Father in the Spirit and in the Truth. O that the &#x17F;ons of men knew, O that the Teachers and Profe&#x17F;&#x17F;ors of this age knew, what they have &#x17F;o long reviled and trampled upon! Surely they would mourn bitterly, ki&#x17F;s the Son, and e&#x17F;cape the wrath.</p>
        <p>Now, if the Lord plea&#x17F;e to &#x17F;mite any ones earthly wi&#x17F;dom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45699:12"/> and comprehen&#x17F;ion (which is the main thing which &#x17F;tands in the way of the pure openings and revelations of the life) and give him the feeling of any thing here written, let him in fear acknowledge the Lord, &#x17F;acrificing to his goodne&#x17F;s, and waiting upon him to be kept in that feeling, not magnifying or villifying any of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;truments, but in meekne&#x17F;s and humility embracing the in&#x17F;tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Almighty, from the hand which he plea&#x17F;eth to give them forth by. As for me, I am but a Shell; and if this party knew me (who &#x17F;ets me up &#x17F;o high, preferring me above many, whom the Lord hath preferred far above me) he would &#x17F;oon acknowledge me to be a very poor, weak, contemptible one: yet this I mu&#x17F;t by no means deny, that the pure Liquor of the eternal Life, at its plea&#x17F;ure &#x17F;pringeth up and i&#x17F;&#x17F;ueth out through me; though I can al&#x17F;o in true under&#x17F;tanding &#x17F;ay, that it i&#x17F;&#x17F;ueth out far oftener and much more abundantly through others. Let it have its honour, where ever it appears; and the Lord bring down that in peoples hearts, which hindreth the owning and receiving of its virtue.</p>

          <p>That after this flight of the true Church and overcoming of the true Mini&#x17F;try, the Dragon erected his fal&#x17F;e Church and Mini&#x17F;try (which had but at be&#x17F;t the Form without the Power) over all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Peoples, Multitudes and Tongues, this is al&#x17F;o as evident, to them that read the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in the Light of that Spirit that wrote them. Is nor the fal&#x17F;e woman (after the true woman was fled) manife&#x17F;tly de&#x17F;cribed? <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. which hath a bewitching Cup of Fornications,
<hi>v.</hi> 2, and 4.

And the Dragon doth not onely &#x17F;et up a fal&#x17F;e Church over the Nations (in many parts whereof the truth had before appeared) <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. but a fal&#x17F;e Mini&#x17F;try al&#x17F;o. There's a fal&#x17F;e Prophet (which deceiveth with Miracles and fal&#x17F;e appearances of truth) advanced in this corrupt &#x17F;tate: which fal&#x17F;e Prophet continues and upholds his deceit over the Nations, till the mighty appearance of Chri&#x17F;t in Spirit and Power, do judge him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. 2
<hi>The&#x17F;&#x17F;.</hi> 2.8. There's a Bea&#x17F;t with <hi>Horns like a Lamb,</hi> who

          <p>Is it not further manife&#x17F;t, that this fal&#x17F;e Church and fal&#x17F;e Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni&#x17F;try, &#x17F;et up in the World by the power of the Dragon, per&#x17F;ecute Gods Witne&#x17F;&#x17F;es to the truth, in all the ages of Antichri&#x17F;ts reign? <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45699:16"/> So &#x17F;oon as ere the Church was fled into the Wilderne&#x17F;s, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon forthwith went to <hi>make War with the remnant of her &#x17F;eed, which kept the Commandments of God, and had the te&#x17F;timony of Je&#x17F;us Chri&#x17F;t,</hi> Rev. 12.17. <hi>And it was given unto him to make War with the Saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Tongues, and Nations.

If any man have an ear let him hear,</hi> Rev. 13.7, 8, 9. <hi>And he had power to give life unto the Image of the Bea&#x17F;t, that the Image of the Bea&#x17F;t &#x17F;hould both &#x17F;peak, and cau&#x17F;e that as many as would not wor&#x17F;hip the Image of the Bea&#x17F;t, &#x17F;hould be killed. And he cau&#x17F;eth all, both &#x17F;mall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a Mark in their right hand, or in their fore-heads. And that no man might buy or &#x17F;ell &#x17F;ave he that had the Mark, or the name of the Bea&#x17F;t, or the number of his Name,</hi> Rev. 13.15, 16, 17. Yea, <hi>the Woman</hi> (the fal&#x17F;e Church, which the Dragon had &#x17F;et up, by his power in the Nations, in&#x17F;tead of the true) was <hi>drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Je&#x17F;us,</hi> Rev. 17.6. O the mi&#x17F;ery, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hard u&#x17F;age of the Witne&#x17F;&#x17F;es of Je&#x17F;us, who have been true Lambs, born of the Power, faithful to the Power, witne&#x17F;&#x17F;ing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain&#x17F;t every Form and appearance of Religion, Doctrine and Wor&#x17F;hip, which hath appeared without the Power (even in the daies of greate&#x17F;t profe&#x17F;&#x17F;ion and highe&#x17F;t devotion under the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;tacy from the Power) how have the&#x17F;e been hunted, per&#x17F;ecuted, devoured by the Wolves in the Sheeps cloathing, who had got the out&#x17F;ide, the garment, the Name of Chri&#x17F;t and Chri&#x17F;tianity, the profe&#x17F;&#x17F;ion of Church, Mini&#x17F;try, and Ordinances, but have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the life, the virtue, the thing it &#x17F;elf; and &#x17F;o have turned again&#x17F;t it, and kept it down, that they might keep up their Form! For let but the Power appear, the Form without the Power is &#x17F;oon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected to be what it is. And this is properly Antichri&#x17F;t and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri&#x17F;tiani&#x17F;me, to wit, Not openly to appear in a direct denyal of Chri&#x17F;t, his Truths and Wor&#x17F;hip, but to &#x17F;et up a way of knowledge and wor&#x17F;hip without his Spirit. Another &#x17F;pirit creeping into the Form, that's Antichri&#x17F;t (and the &#x17F;etting up ob&#x17F;ervation and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Form out of the Life and Power, that's Antichri&#x17F;tia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni&#x17F;me) and this is the per&#x17F;ecuter, de&#x17F;troyer, and devourer about Religion.</p>
          <p><pb n="24" facs="tcp:45699:17"/>Now though the Lord hath &#x17F;uffered this fal&#x17F;e Church, and fal&#x17F;e Prophet to reign long in the Dragons power, and to revile and worry his poor Lambs, in every age of Antichri&#x17F;ts Reign; yet the Lord hath appointed a &#x17F;ea&#x17F;on to judge this fal&#x17F;e Church, <hi>Rev.</hi>

          <p>O how deeply doth it concern <hi>England,</hi> her Rulers, her Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yea the whole People thereof, to con&#x17F;ider their Ways, to con&#x17F;ider their Wor&#x17F;hip, to con&#x17F;ider their Church-&#x17F;tate, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ider their Mini&#x17F;try, that they be not overwhelmed at unawars in the bitter wrath of the Almighty, before which there is no &#x17F;tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

          <p>If men con&#x17F;ult concerning the&#x17F;e things in the wi&#x17F;dom of the fle&#x17F;h, they will be entangled and erre; for that eye cannot &#x17F;ee the My&#x17F;teries of the Kingdom, or the cour&#x17F;e either of Truth or Deceit. The Go&#x17F;pel, the Eternal Truth, the true Church, the true Mini&#x17F;try, are all Spiritual, (not new &#x17F;hadowes, as the things under the mini&#x17F;tration of the Law were, but Spirit and Sub&#x17F;tance) and they can onely be &#x17F;een by the &#x17F;pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eye of the children of Wi&#x17F;dom. The wi&#x17F;e Hunters, and diligent Enquirers, into the comprehending part, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the Womb or the way of Life, or the way of the Wor&#x17F;hip of that which is begotten in the Life, or Gods way of Mini&#x17F;try, which he hath appointed for the feeding and pre&#x17F;erving of the Life.

Ah poor

          <p>The great Controver&#x17F;ie of this Age is about Church and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni&#x17F;try, which mu&#x17F;t carry it, the Form or the Power; Whether the Church and Mini&#x17F;try, &#x17F;hall take place which was before the Apo&#x17F;tacy, or that which hath &#x17F;prung up in or &#x17F;ince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;tacy? Whether mans wi&#x17F;dom &#x17F;hall determine which is the true Church and its true Mini&#x17F;try, or whether the Spirit of God &#x17F;hall determine it?

          <p>CHri&#x17F;ts Kingdom, Gods Kingdom, the Kingdom of Heaven (for they are all one and the &#x17F;ame) is that &#x17F;eed of Eternal Life, which God hath hid in the hearts of the &#x17F;ons of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gathereth them back unto him&#x17F;elf, bringeth them under the Yoak of his Government, ruleth over them, and reigneth in them.</p>
          <p>This Kingdom is likened to <hi>a grain of mu&#x17F;tard &#x17F;eed,</hi> for its &#x17F;mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne&#x17F;s; <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45699:18"/> to <hi>a Pearl,</hi> for its Riches, Value and Worth; to <hi>Leaven,</hi> for its &#x17F;preading nature: and many other Parables did Chri&#x17F;t make u&#x17F;e of to di&#x17F;cover it by, as to <hi>a piece of Silver,</hi> which the woman that lo&#x17F;t it, lighting the candle, &#x17F;weeping the hou&#x17F;e and &#x17F;earching it diligently, at length found it even there where &#x17F;he had lo&#x17F;t it.</p>
          <p>Man fallen from God, is become lo&#x17F;t as to the Lord, and as to his own happine&#x17F;s in the Lord, being driven from his ble&#x17F;&#x17F;ed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ence, and divine Image, Life and Spirit, into the earthly Spirit, Image and Life which he cho&#x17F;e. Yet in this Earth, in this Field of the World God hath hid &#x17F;omewhat, even the everla&#x17F;ting Pearl; which when man is awakened to &#x17F;eek, and findeth in the living Breath, in the Eternal Light of Life; it is able to redeem him, it is able to over&#x17F;pread, (he becoming &#x17F;ubject to the Laws, Leadings, Teachings and Power of it) and leaven him into the Likene&#x17F;s and Image of the pure Life and Spirit.</p>
          <p>Or not men knew the Gift of God, O that men knew the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha&#x17F;e of the blood of Chri&#x17F;t, O that men knew that Spiritual good thing, which Chri&#x17F;t (who died for them) hath given to Redeem them by, that in that they might be united to Chri&#x17F;t, and &#x17F;o by him be Renewed and Re&#x17F;tored to God. For as the Father recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth none but through the Son; &#x17F;o the Son receiveth none but in that Gift, which he be&#x17F;toweth from the Father. He owneth no Faith, no Love, no Hope, no Repentance, no Obedience, but what &#x17F;pringeth from that, and &#x17F;tandeth in that.</p>
          <p>Now as man is Born of this, is Leavened by this, (as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a fool in his own earthly wi&#x17F;dom and excellency of the fallen Spirit, and becomes a Babe, a Child, Simple, Innocent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) &#x17F;o he enters into the Kingdome, being ingrafted into the Root through the virtue of this which is given him from the Root, and &#x17F;o grows up in this, and this in him. And here's the new Nature, the new Life, the new Heart, the new Spirit, in which the Unity and Fellow&#x17F;hip with God is again known, and the Di&#x17F;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union with the World, the Wi&#x17F;dom, the Intere&#x17F;ts, the Fa&#x17F;hions, the Cu&#x17F;toms, the Fears, the Hopes, the Delights, the Joys, of this World and whatever el&#x17F;e is of it. For Chri&#x17F;t, as he is not of the World, &#x17F;o he calleth men out of the World; and they which follow him, and become his Di&#x17F;ciples, go out of the World after him; that is, travel in Spirit and Conver&#x17F;ation from what is of the Earth, <pb n="27" facs="tcp:45699:18"/> from what ever is <hi>not of the Father, but of the World. They are not of the World, even as I am not of the World</hi> (&#x17F;aith Chri&#x17F;t concerning his Di&#x17F;ciples, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>therefore the world hateth them.</hi>
               </p>
          <p>The Laws of this Kingdom are given forth in the Kingdom, from the Covenant of life, which is made there in Chri&#x17F;t. They are written in the heart, in the mind, as far as it is renewed. There the <hi>fear</hi> is put, there the <hi>eternal Wi&#x17F;dom</hi> is opened, there is <hi>Sion</hi> known, and the <hi>Jeru&#x17F;alem</hi> which is from above, and the <hi>Laws</hi> of eternal life i&#x17F;&#x17F;ue fre&#x17F;h from it, and are revealed by the life, in the heart which is turned towards the life. There &#x17F;in is reproved, and everla&#x17F;ting Righteou&#x17F;ne&#x17F;s manife&#x17F;ted, in the Light which cannot deceive: and as the heart is made &#x17F;ubject under the yoke, &#x17F;o &#x17F;in is wrought out and Righteou&#x17F;ne&#x17F;s brought in; and under the Cro&#x17F;s, or yoke of life, the blood of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verla&#x17F;ting Covenant runs through the ve&#x17F;&#x17F;el, to keep it pure, &#x17F;weet, clean and fre&#x17F;h in the life.</p>
          <p>This then is the Government of Chri&#x17F;t, to be &#x17F;ubject to his Spirit, which appears and opens his will, in the gift of grace which comes from him; to feel his living breath, by which the heart is begotten to God, out of the Region of darkne&#x17F;s; to know the movings, the &#x17F;tirrings, the leadings, the &#x17F;teps of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> who is <hi>the Captain of our Salvation;</hi> and to follow him where ever he goes, doing all things that he commands, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things that he forbids, <hi>without murmuring, without di&#x17F;puting.</hi>

O that men were awakened to con&#x17F;ider of things as indeed they are: for Religion is not &#x17F;uch an outward Form of Doctrine, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;hip of any &#x17F;ort, as men generally (who&#x17F;e poor Souls are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through the &#x17F;ubtilty of the powers of darkne&#x17F;s) are too apt

O that men would &#x17F;uffer the wearing out of this earthly &#x17F;pirit and wi&#x17F;dom, that they might become like God, be formed into and live in his Image. How long &#x17F;hall the De&#x17F;troyer in every age, prejudice men again&#x17F;t them in that age, which &#x17F;eek their good with their hearts! How long will the world &#x17F;tand in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity again&#x17F;t the generation of God's choice, and provoke the Lord to wrath again&#x17F;t them! Surely the &#x17F;pirit of this world will try it out to the very la&#x17F;t again&#x17F;t the Spirit of God: for indeed, the &#x17F;pirit of this world is not &#x17F;ubject to the Spirit of God, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be, and &#x17F;o cannot endure the Government of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (which is not of this world) to be &#x17F;et up in the &#x17F;ight of it.</p>
          <p>Yet the Government of Chri&#x17F;t and his Kingdom, is not oppo&#x17F;ite to any ju&#x17F;t Government of a Nation or People. Chri&#x17F;t's Government is a Righteous Government of the heart, or inner man chiefly, which doth not oppo&#x17F;e a Righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the outward man. Nay, tho&#x17F;e who are Chri&#x17F;t's &#x17F;ubjects, and &#x17F;ingly obedient to his Law of Righteou&#x17F;ne&#x17F;s in their &#x17F;pirits; are more faithful to men, and more &#x17F;ubject to any ju&#x17F;t Law of Government, than others can be: for their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and &#x17F;ubjection is out of love, and for Con&#x17F;cience &#x17F;ake. But this is it which offends the world, men many times make Laws in their own will, and according to their own wi&#x17F;dom (now the wi&#x17F;dom of the world is corrupt, and hath erred from the guide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God) and are not free from &#x17F;elf-ends and intere&#x17F;ts, not being gathered into that, which clean&#x17F;eth and keepeth pure the naturals. Now that which is of God, cannot bow to any thing which is corrupt in man: it can lye down and &#x17F;uffer, and bear the plowing of long and deep &#x17F;urrows upon its back, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <pb n="29" facs="tcp:45699:19"/> act that which is again&#x17F;t its life. It cannot be di&#x17F;loyal to its King, to gratifie the &#x17F;pirit of this world; but what Practice or Te&#x17F;timony its King calls for, again&#x17F;t the evil and corruption of this world, it mu&#x17F;t obey &#x17F;ingly and faithfully.</p>
          <p>God in every age &#x17F;o bringeth forth and ordereth his innocent Lambs and People, as that they are &#x17F;till offen&#x17F;ive to the pre&#x17F;ent age. The Lord fitteth them, and calleth them forth to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne&#x17F;&#x17F;es again&#x17F;t the evils of the pre&#x17F;ent age, How can they but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it? Can darkne&#x17F;s chu&#x17F;e but hate the light, which &#x17F;peaks again&#x17F;t it? How can darkne&#x17F;s in Power and Dominion, bear to be reproved by a mean contemptible appearance of the Light, in mean and contemptible ve&#x17F;&#x17F;els? For God chu&#x17F;eth <hi>the weak, and fooli&#x17F;h things of this world, and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> Look into former ages, How did God reprove the Kings and Princes of <hi>I&#x17F;rael?</hi> Not by the eminent Prie&#x17F;ts and Prophets, whom they expected to be taught by, but by Herd&#x17F;men, by Plowmen, by Prophets which they de&#x17F;pi&#x17F;ed. How did he overcome the Heatheni&#x17F;h world, yea, and the Jewi&#x17F;h corrupted &#x17F;tate? Was it by wi&#x17F;e learned men (by the learned Scribes and Phari&#x17F;ees among the Jews, or by the wi&#x17F;e Grecians among the Heathen) or by Fi&#x17F;hermen and Publicans? And how &#x17F;hall the recovery out of the Apo&#x17F;tacy, and the reproof of the Antichri&#x17F;tian world be? Shall it be by wi&#x17F;e Synods and Councils of learned and Orthodox men among them (as they &#x17F;peak?) Or &#x17F;hall it be by the learning of the &#x17F;pirit in &#x17F;uch as the&#x17F;e contemn? When God hath the rich Trea&#x17F;ure of the Knowledge of his Kingdom to manife&#x17F;t in the world, he chu&#x17F;es earthen ve&#x17F;&#x17F;els, weak ve&#x17F;&#x17F;els, poor contemptible per&#x17F;ons (he appears there, where the eye of man lea&#x17F;t look for him) that <hi>the excellency of the Power</hi> might appear to be of him wholly, and that the ve&#x17F;&#x17F;el might rob him of none of the glory of it. Now the Lord hath not only cho&#x17F;en, in this day of his great appearance in Spirit to the &#x17F;pirits of his People, mean in&#x17F;truments, but mean things al&#x17F;o, fooli&#x17F;h things, weak things, the keeping on of an Hat, the u&#x17F;e of ordinary Language, the appearing in mean habits and de&#x17F;pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;ed ge&#x17F;tures, yea, and in a fooli&#x17F;h way of Preaching (indeed it is &#x17F;o, to that which hath not the &#x17F;avour of the Vertue and Power of the life in it) And how can the wi&#x17F;dom of man but &#x17F;tumble <pb n="30" facs="tcp:45699:20"/> at it? Who would think that God &#x17F;hould require &#x17F;uch things, or appear in &#x17F;uch thirds? O living eternal Power, how is thy migthy Pre&#x17F;ence and Appearance vailed from all, that look for it in any way of mans ob&#x17F;ervation, or judge it with the eye of mans wi&#x17F;dom! <hi>Verily, thou art a God that ha&#x17F;t hid thy &#x17F;elf from the earthly &#x17F;pirit in its utmo&#x17F;t wi&#x17F;dom, yea, in its utmo&#x17F;t &#x17F;earch after the knowledge of, and in the mid&#x17F;t of the highe&#x17F;t porfe&#x17F;&#x17F;ion of Religion!</hi> Which of the Wi&#x17F;e, which of the Scribes in this Age can di&#x17F;cern any of thy Pathes, or &#x17F;o much as one of thy Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>&#x17F;teps! Oh that men would fear before the Lord, and be &#x17F;ure to Govern in that which is of God, and then they &#x17F;hould harm none of His, nor hazard the &#x17F;haking of their Government: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of God, both within and without, mu&#x17F;t fall in the day of Gods Power. O happy is he, who is now made willing to part with that, which God is determined to rent from man, that his &#x17F;tanding may be in that which cannot be &#x17F;haken. For there hath been a great Earthquake in this Nation, both of things without and of things within; and there yet remains &#x17F;omewhat to be &#x17F;haken both without and within, that the Glory of God may have room to appear. O <hi>England, Ki&#x17F;s the Son le&#x17F;t he be angry:</hi> Let all &#x17F;uch Laws and Cu&#x17F;toms as are not of Him, fall before Him, and whatever is of Him, let it bow unto Him (both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out) that his wrath break not forth like a fire, which none can quench. For the Lord hath mighty things to bring to pa&#x17F;s, and he hath a mighty Arm of Power to effect them by, and what &#x17F;hall be able to &#x17F;tand before him, that &#x17F;tands in his way?</p>
