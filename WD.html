In this chapter we discuss some additional issues relating to the way that written language is represented in a TEI document. In sections <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#WDNE" title="Is Your Journey Really Necessary"><span class="headingNumber">5.1 </span>Is Your Journey Really Necessary?</a> and <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-20" title="Markup Constructs for Representation of Characters and Glyphs"><span class="headingNumber">5.2 </span>Markup Constructs for Representation of Characters and Glyphs</a> we introduce markup which may be used to represent and document non-standard characters, that is, written symbols for which no codepoint exists in Unicode. The same markup may be used to annotate existing characters according to their visual or other properties, and thus process them as distinct glyphs (see section <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-30" title="Annotating Characters"><span class="headingNumber">5.3 </span>Annotating Characters</a>), or to define new characters or glyphs (section <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-40" title="Adding New Characters"><span class="headingNumber">5.4 </span>Adding New Characters</a>). We also provide recommendations concerning the Unicode Private Use Area (<a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-50" title="How to Use Code Points from the Private Use Area"><span class="headingNumber">5.5 </span>How to Use Code Points from the Private Use Area</a>. Finally, in section <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#WDWM" title="Writing Modes"><span class="headingNumber">5.6 </span>Writing Modes</a> we discuss ways of documenting the writing mode used in a source text, that is, the directionality of the script, the orientation of individual characters, and related questions.</p><div class="div2" id="WDNE"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"></li><li class="subtoc"><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#D25-20"><span class="headingNumber">5.2 </span>Markup Constructs for Representation of Characters and Glyphs</a></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h3><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#WDNE" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: Is Your Journey Really Necessary?</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">5.1 </span><span class="head">Is Your Journey Really Necessary?</span></h3><p>Despite the availability of Unicode, text encoders still sometimes find that the published repertoire of available characters is inadequate to their needs. This is particularly the case when dealing with ancient languages, for which encoding standards do not yet exist, or where an encoder wishes to represent variant forms of a character or <span class="term">glyphs</span>. The module defined by this chapter provides a mechanism to satisfy that need, while retaining compatibility with standards.</p><p>When encoders encounter some graphical unit in a document which is to be represented electronically, the first issue to be resolved should be <span class="q">‘Is this really a different character?’</span> To determine whether a particular graphical unit <em>is</em> a character or not, see <a class="link_ptr" href="CH.html#D4-42" title="Terminology and Key Concepts"><span class="headingNumber"></span>Terminology and Key Concepts</a>.</p><p>If the unit is indeed determined to be a character, the next question should be <span class="q">‘Has this character been encoded already?’</span> In order to determine whether a character has been encoded, encoders should follow the following steps: </p><ol class="numbered"><li class="item"><p>Check the Unicode web site at <a class="link_ptr" href="http://www.unicode.org"><span>http://www.unicode.org</span></a>, in particular the page <a class="link_ref" href="http://unicode.org/standard/where/">"Where is my Character?"</a>, and the associated character code charts. Alternatively, users can check the latest published version of <span class="titlem">The Unicode Standard</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="BIB.html#CH-BIBL-3" title="The Unicode Standard Version 5.0Unicode ConsortiumAddisonWesley Professional2006">Unicode Consortium (2006)</a>), though the web site is often more up to date than the printed version, and should be checked for preference.</p> <p>The pictures (‘glyphs’) in the Unicode code charts are only meant to be representative, not definitive. If a specific form of an already encoded character is required for a project, refer to the guidelines contained below under <a class="link_ref" href="WD.html#D25-30" title="Annotating Characters">Annotating Characters</a>. Remember that your encoded document may be rendered on a system which has different fonts from yours: if the specific form of a character is important to you, then you should document it.</p></li><li class="item">Check the Proposed New Characters web page (<a class="link_ptr" href="http://unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html"><span>http://unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html</span></a>) to see whether the character is in line for approval.</li><li class="item">Ask on the Unicode email list (<a class="link_ptr" href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/distlist.html"><span>http://www.unicode.org/consortium/distlist.html</span></a>) to see whether a proposal is pending, or to determine whether this character is considered eligible for addition to the Unicode Standard.</li></ol><p>Since there are now close to 100,000 characters in Unicode, chances are good that what you need is already there, but it might not be easy to find, since it might have a different name in Unicode. Look again, this time at other sites, for example <a class="link_ptr" href="http://www.eki.ee/letter/"><span>http://www.eki.ee/letter/</span></a>, which also provide searches based on scripts and languages. Take care, however, that all the properties of what seems to be a relevant character are consistent with those of the character you are looking for. For example, if your character is definitely a digit, but the properties of the best match you can find for it say that it is a letter, you may have a character not yet defined in Unicode.</p><p>In general, it is advisable to avoid Unicode characters generally described as presentation forms.<span id="Note60_return"><a class="notelink" title="Specifically, characters in the Unicode blocks Alphabetic Presentation Forms, Arabic Presentation Forms-A, Arabic Presentation Forms-B, Letterlike Sym…" href="#Note60"><sup>23</sup></a></span> However, if the character you are looking for is being used in a notation (rather than as part of the orthography of a language) then it is quite acceptable to select characters from the Mathematical Operators block, provided that they have the appropriate properties (i.e. <code>So</code>: Symbol, Other; or <code>Sm</code>: Symbol, Math).</p><p>An encoded character may be precomposed or it may be formed from base characters and combining diacritical marks. Either will suffice for a character to be "found" as an encoded character. </p><p>If there are several possible Unicode characters to choose amongst, it is good practice to consult other colleagues and practitioners to see whether a consensus has emerged in favour of one or other of them. </p><p>If, however, no suitable form of your character seems to exist, the next question will be: <span class="q">‘Does the graphical unit in question represent a variant form of a known character, or does it represent a completely unencoded character?’</span> If the character is determined to be missing from the Unicode Standard, it would be helpful to submit the new character for inclusion (see <a class="link_ptr" href="http://unicode.org/pending/proposals.html"><span>http://unicode.org/pending/proposals.html</span></a>).</p><p>These guidelines will help you proceed once you have identified a given graphical unit as either a variant or an unencoded character. Determining this will require knowledge of the contents of the document that you have. The first case will be called <em>annotation</em> of a character, while the second case will be called <em>adding</em> of a new character. How to handle graphical units that represent variants will be discussed below (<a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-30" title="Annotating Characters"><span class="headingNumber">5.3 </span>Annotating Characters</a>) while the problem of representing new characters will be dealt with in section <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-40" title="Adding New Characters"><span class="headingNumber">5.4 </span>Adding New Characters</a>.</p><p>While there is some overlap between these requirements, distinct specialized markup constructs have been created for each of these cases. These constructs are presented in section <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-20" title="Markup Constructs for Representation of Characters and Glyphs"><span class="headingNumber">5.2 </span>Markup Constructs for Representation of Characters and Glyphs</a> below.</p></div><div class="div2" id="D25-20"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"><span class="previousLink"> « </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#WDNE"><span class="headingNumber">5.1 </span>Is Your Journey Really Necessary?</a></li><li class="subtoc"><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#D25-30"><span class="headingNumber">5.3 </span>Annotating Characters</a></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h3><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#D25-20" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: Markup Constructs for Representation of Characters and Glyphs</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">5.2 </span><span class="head">Markup Constructs for Representation of Characters and Glyphs</span></h3><p>An XML document can, in principle, contain any defined Unicode character. The standard allows these characters to be represented either directly, using an appropriate encoding (UTF-8 by default), or indirectly by means of a <span class="term">numeric character reference</span> (NCR), such as <code>&amp;#196;</code> (A-umlaut). The encoder can also restrict the range of characters which are represented directly in a document (or part of it) by adding a suitable encoding declaration. For example, if a document begins with the declaration <code>&lt;?xml encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;</code> any Unicode characters which are not in the ISO-8859-1 character set must be represented by NCRs.</p><p>The <span class="mentioned">gaiji</span> module defined by this chapter adds a further way of representing specific characters and glyphs in a document. (Gaiji is from Japanese <span lang="ja">外字</span>, meaning <span class="gloss">external characters</span>.) This allows the encoder to distinguish characters and glyphs which Unicode regards as identical, to add new nonstandard characters or glyphs, and to represent Unicode characters not available in the document encoding by an alternative means.</p><p>The mechanism provided here consists functionally of two parts: </p><ol class="numbered"><li class="item">an element <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a>, which serves as a proxy for new characters or glyphs</li><li class="item">elements <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> and <a class="gi" title="(character glyph) provides descriptive information about a character glyph." href="ref-glyph.html">glyph</a>, providing information about such characters or glyphs; these elements are stored in the <a class="gi" title="(character declarations) provides information about nonstandard characters and glyphs." href="ref-charDecl.html">charDecl</a> element in the header.</li></ol><p>When the gaiji module is included in a schema, the <a class="gi" title="(character declarations) provides information about nonstandard characters and glyphs." href="ref-charDecl.html">charDecl</a> element is added to the <a class="link_odd" title="groups elements which may be used inside &lt;encodingDesc&gt; and appear multiple times." href="ref-model.encodingDescPart.html">model.encodingDescPart</a> class, and the <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> element is added to the phrase class. These elements and their components are documented in the rest of this section.</p><p>The Unicode standard defines properties for all the characters it defines in the Unicode Character Database, knowledge of which is usually built into text processing systems. If the character represented by the <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> element does not exist in Unicode at all, its properties are not available. If the character represented is an existing Unicode character, but is not available in the document character set recognized by a given text processing system, it may also be convenient to have access to its properties in the same way. The <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element makes it possible to store properties for use by such applications in a standard way.</p><p>The list of attributes (properties) for characters is modelled on those in the Unicode Character Database, which distinguishes <span class="term">normative</span> and <span class="term">informative</span> character properties. Additional, non-Unicode, properties may also be supplied. Since the list of properties will vary with different versions of the Unicode Standard, there may not be an exact correspondence between them and the list of properties defined in these Guidelines.</p><p>Usage examples for these elements are given below at <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-30" title="Annotating Characters"><span class="headingNumber">5.3 </span>Annotating Characters</a> and <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-40" title="Adding New Characters"><span class="headingNumber">5.4 </span>Adding New Characters</a>. The gaiji module itself is formally defined in section <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#WSD-DEF" title="Formal Definition"><span class="headingNumber">5.10 </span>Formal Definition</a> below. It declares the following additional elements: </p><ul class="specList"><li><span class="specList-elementSpec"><a href="ref-charDecl.html">charDecl</a></span> (character declarations) provides information about nonstandard characters and glyphs.</li><li><span class="specList-elementSpec"><a href="ref-g.html">g</a></span> (character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character.<table class="specDesc"><tr><td class="Attribute"><span class="att">ref</span></td><td>points to a description of the character or glyph intended.</td></tr></table></li></ul><p> The <a class="gi" title="(character declarations) provides information about nonstandard characters and glyphs." href="ref-charDecl.html">charDecl</a> element is a member of the class <a class="link_odd" title="groups elements which may be used inside &lt;encodingDesc&gt; and appear multiple times." href="ref-model.encodingDescPart.html">model.encodingDescPart</a>, and thus becomes available within <a class="gi" title="(encoding description) documents the relationship between an electronic text and the source or sources from which it was derived." href="ref-encodingDesc.html">encodingDesc</a> when this module is included in a schema. The <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> element is the only member of the class <a class="link_odd" title="groups elements used to represent individual non-Unicode characters or glyphs." href="ref-model.gLike.html">model.gLike</a>: this class is referenced as an alternative to plain text in almost every element which contains plain text, thus permitting the <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> element also to appear at such places when this module is included in a schema.</p><p>The following elements may appear within a <a class="gi" title="(character declarations) provides information about nonstandard characters and glyphs." href="ref-charDecl.html">charDecl</a> element: </p><ul class="specList"><li><span class="specList-elementSpec"><a href="ref-desc.html">desc</a></span> (description) contains a brief description of the object documented by its parent element, including its intended usage, purpose, or application where this is appropriate.</li><li><span class="specList-elementSpec"><a href="ref-char.html">char</a></span> (character) provides descriptive information about a character.</li><li><span class="specList-elementSpec"><a href="ref-glyph.html">glyph</a></span> (character glyph) provides descriptive information about a character glyph.</li></ul><p>The <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> and <a class="gi" title="(character glyph) provides descriptive information about a character glyph." href="ref-glyph.html">glyph</a> elements have similar contents and are used in similar ways, but their functions are different. The <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element is provided to define a character which is not available in the current document character set, for whatever reason, as stated above. The <a class="gi" title="(character glyph) provides descriptive information about a character glyph." href="ref-glyph.html">glyph</a> element is used to annotate a character that has already been defined somewhere (either in the document character set, or through a <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element) by providing a specific glyph that shows how a character appeared in the original document. This is necessary since Unicode code points refer not to a single, specific glyph shape of a character, but rather to a set of glyphs, any of which may be used to render the code point in question; in some cases they can differ considerably.</p><p>The <a class="gi" title="(character glyph) provides descriptive information about a character glyph." href="ref-glyph.html">glyph</a> element is provided for cases where the encoder wants to specify a specific glyph (or family of glyphs) out of all possible glyphs. Unfortunately, due to the way Unicode has been defined, there are cases where several glyphs that logically belong together have been given separate code points, especially in the blocks defining East Asian characters. In such cases, <a class="gi" title="(character glyph) provides descriptive information about a character glyph." href="ref-glyph.html">glyph</a> elements can also be used to express the view that these apparently distinct characters are to be regarded as instances of the same character (see further <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-30" title="Annotating Characters"><span class="headingNumber">5.3 </span>Annotating Characters</a>).</p><p>The Unicode Standard recommends naming conventions which should be followed strictly where the intention is to annotate an existing Unicode character, and which may also be used as a model when creating new names for characters or glyphs<span id="Note61_return"><a class="notelink" title="It should be noted, however, that this naming convention cannot meaningfully be applied to East Asian characters; the typical Unicode descriptions for…" href="#Note61"><sup>24</sup></a></span>.

The <a class="gi" title="groups elements representing or containing graphic information such as an illustration, formula, or figure." href="ref-figure.html">figure</a> element, however, is used here only to link to an image of the character or glyph under discussion, or to contain a representation of it in SVG.

As elsewhere, the <span class="att">mimeType</span> attribute of <a class="gi" title="indicates the location of a graphic or illustration, either forming part of a text, or providing an image of it." href="ref-graphic.html">graphic</a> should be used to specify the format of the image.</p><div class="p">The <a class="gi" title="(character mapping) contains one or more characters which are related to the parent character or glyph in some respect, as specified by the @type attribute." href="ref-mapping.html">mapping</a> element is similar to the standard TEI <a class="gi" title="(equivalent) specifies a component which is considered equivalent to the parent element, either by co-reference, or by external link." href="ref-equiv.html">equiv</a> element.

In such an occasion, one might want to retain the character as used, but add information in a way so that a normalizer (for search or indexing operations) could take advantage of this information. To achieve this, we simply define within a <a class="gi" title="(character declarations) provides information about nonstandard characters and glyphs." href="ref-charDecl.html">charDecl</a> element a <a class="gi" title="(character glyph) provides descriptive information about a character glyph." href="ref-glyph.html">glyph</a> that has two <a class="gi" title="(character mapping) contains one or more characters which are related to the parent character or glyph in some respect, as specified by the @type attribute." href="ref-mapping.html">mapping</a> elements, as shown here: <div id="index-egXML-d50e56843" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;charDecl&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;glyph <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="<span class="attributevalue">u8aaa</span>"&gt;</span><br />  <span class="element">&lt;mapping <span class="attribute">type</span>="<span class="attributevalue">Unicode</span>"&gt;</span>說<span class="element">&lt;/mapping&gt;</span><br />  <span class="element">&lt;mapping <span class="attribute">type</span>="<span class="attributevalue">standard</span>"&gt;</span>説<span class="element">&lt;/mapping&gt;</span><br /> <span class="element">&lt;/glyph&gt;</span><br /><span class="element">&lt;/charDecl&gt;</span></div> The first of these <a class="gi" title="(character mapping) contains one or more characters which are related to the parent character or glyph in some respect, as specified by the @type attribute." href="ref-mapping.html">mapping</a>s, of type <span class="val">Unicode</span>, simply maps our glyph to the code point where Unicode defined it.

Recommendations on how to use such PUA characters are given in the following section.</p><div class="p">In some circumstances, it may be desirable to provide a single precomposed form of a character that is encoded in Unicode only as a sequence of code points. For example, in Medieval Nordic material, a character looking like a lowercase letter Y with a dot and an acute-accent above it may be encountered so frequently that the encoder wishes to treat it as a single precomposed character with one single coded value. In the transcription concerned, the encoder enters this letter as <code>&amp;ydotacute;</code>, which when the transcription is processed can then be expanded in one of three ways, depending on the mapping in force. The entity reference might be translated into the sequence of corresponding Unicode code points or into some locally-defined PUA character (say <code>&amp;#xE0A4;</code>) for local processing only. Both these options have disadvantages; the former loses the fact that the sequence of composed characters is regarded as a single object; the second is not reliably portable. Therefore, the recommended representation is to use the <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> element defined by the module defined in this chapter: <div id="index-egXML-d50e56922" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;g <span class="attribute">ref</span>="<span class="attributevalue">#ydotacute</span>"/&gt;</span></div>.

The two mappings indicate firstly that the standard form of this character is the character <code>&amp;#x4EBA;</code>, and secondly that the character used to represent this character locally is the PUA character <code>&amp;#xE000;</code>.

As of this writing (Unicode 5.0), there are around 137,000 code points available in this area, which should be enough for most needs. No code point assignments will be made to this area by standard bodies and only some very basic default properties have been assigned (which may be overridden where necessary by the mechanism outlined in this chapter). Therefore, unlike all other code points defined by the Unicode Standard, PUA code points should <em>not</em> be used directly in documents intended for blind interchange. </p><p>In the two previous examples, we mentioned that the variant characters concerned might well be assigned specific code points from the PUA. This might, for example, facilitate the use of a particular font which displays the desired character at this code point in the local processing environment. Since however this assignment would be valid only on the local site, documents containing such code points are unsuitable for blind interchange. During the process of preparing such documents for interchange, any PUA code points should be replaced by an appropriate use of the <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> element, such as <span class="tag">&lt;g ref="#xxxx"&gt;</span>, thus associating the character required with the documentation of it provided by the referenced <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element. The PUA character used during the preparation of the document might be recorded in the <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element, as shown in the example in <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html#D25-40" title="Adding New Characters"><span class="headingNumber">5.4 </span>Adding New Characters</a>, or retained as content of the <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> element. However, since there is no requirement that the same PUA character be used to represent it at the receiving site, and since it may well be the case that this other site has already made an assignment of some other character to the original PUA code point, it is best practice to remove the locally-defined PUA character. It is to be expected that a further translation into the local processing environment at the receiving site will be necessary to handle such characters, during which variant letters can be converted to hitherto unused code points on the basis of the information provided in the <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element.</p><p>This mechanism is rather weak in cases where DOM trees or parsed XML fragments are exchanged, which may increasingly be the case. The best an application can do here is to treat any occurrence of a PUA character only in the context of the local document and use the properties provided through the <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element as a handle to the character in other contexts.</p><p>In the fullness of time, a character may become standardized, and thus assigned a specific code point outside the PUA. Documents which have been encoded using the mechanism must at the least ensure that this changed code point is recorded within the relevant <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element; it will however normally be simpler to remove the <a class="gi" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> element and replace all occurrences of <a class="gi" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> elements which reference it by occurrences of the newly coded character.</p></div><div class="div2" id="WDWM"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"><span class="previousLink"> « </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#D25-50"><span class="headingNumber">5.5 </span>How to Use Code Points from the Private Use Area</a></li><li class="subtoc"><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#WDWMEG"><span class="headingNumber">5.7 </span>Examples of Different Writing Modes</a></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h3><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#WDWM" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: 
                 Writing Modes</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">5.6 </span><span class="head">Writing Modes</span></h3><p>The scripts used for writing human languages vary not only in the glyphs they use, but also in the way (or ways) that those glyphs are arranged on the writing surface. For the majority of modern languages, writing is arranged as a series of lines which are to be read from top to bottom. Within each line, individual characters are frequently presented from left to right (English, Russian, Greek), but there are also several widely-used scripts which run right-to-left (Arabic, Hebrew). Writing in which the lines of glyphs are presented vertically and read from right to left is also often encountered, notably in older East Asian scripts (Sinitic characters, Japanese Kana, Korean Hangul, Vietnamese chữ nôm). In many cases, a language normally uses the same <span class="term">writing mode</span> (we use this term to refer to the orientation of individual glyphs within a line and the order in which glyphs and lines should be read), but there are exceptions in which the same language may appear in different modes, for example either vertically or horizontally. Many East Asian scripts were traditionally written from top to bottom within the line, with their lines sequenced from right to left. Although modern Japanese, Chinese, and Korean are often written horizontally, the traditional vertical writing mode is still widely used. There are also comparatively rare cases of ancient scripts written with lines running left to right, each line being read top to bottom (Ancient Uighur, classical Mongolian and Manchu), or scripts such as Ogham where the writing direction may start from the bottom left and run around the edge of an inscribed object.</p><p>When different languages are combined, it is possible that different writing modes will be needed: for example, in Hebrew text, running right to left, sequences of Latin digits still run left to right. When different writing modes are available for the same language, it may be that different glyphs will be preferred when the script is used in different modes. For example, when Japanese is written horizontally, the Unicode character U+3001, the ‘ideographic comma’, is used in preference to Unicode character U+FE11, the vertical mode comma. This ensures that the comma appears in the correct position relative to the surrounding glyphs. Even for scripts which are usually written in exactly the same way, different writing modes may be encountered in particular contexts; for example when a language using Roman script is embedded within vertically-organized Chinese text, it may sometimes be displayed vertically and sometimes horizontally. The writing mode may also vary in response to layout constraints such as those imposed by a complex table, where column or row labels may be written vertically or diagonally to make the most effective use of available space, just as it may vary in response to the size and shape of the carrier in the case of a monumental inscription.</p><p>For many, perhaps most, TEI documents there may be no need to encode the writing mode explicitly, even in so-called "mixed mode" texts containing passages written in languages which use different writing modes. Modern printed texts in most European languages, for instance, may be expected to use left-to-right/top-to-bottom directionality; while Arabic or Hebrew texts are expected to run right-to-left/top-to-bottom. In a TEI document, language and script are explicitly stated in the markup using the attribute <span class="att">xml:lang</span>; this indication will usually imply a particular default writing mode. Even where this attribute is not used, passages in different scripts will use different Unicode characters, and will thus imply a particular default writing mode.</p><p>Consider the case of an English text containing a few Arabic words : </p><pre class="pre_eg cdata">The Arabic term قلم رصاص means "pencil".</pre><p>A correct TEI encoding might read as follows: </p><div id="index-egXML-d50e57066" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;s <span class="attribute">xml:lang</span>="<span class="attributevalue">en</span>"&gt;</span>The Arabic term<br /><span class="element">&lt;term <span class="attribute">xml:lang</span>="<span class="attributevalue">ar</span>"&gt;</span>قلم رصاص<span class="element">&lt;/term&gt;</span> means "pencil".<span class="element">&lt;/s&gt;</span></div><p>We might assume that it is the presence of the <span class="att">xml:lang</span> attribute with value <span class="val">ar</span> that causes processing software to display the Arabic from right to left, but in fact, this is not the case. The order in which the Arabic characters appear when rendered would be the same, even if the markup were not present:</p><div id="index-egXML-d50e57080" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;s&gt;</span>The Arabic term قلم رصاص means "pencil".<span class="element">&lt;/s&gt;</span></div><p>This is because Arabic glyphs are always displayed right to left, even when they appear within a left-to-right English sentence. Like most other codepoints in the Unicode standard, they have a specific directionality setting which helps any rendering software determine how they should be ordered. The Latin glyph "a" has a strong left-to-right bidirectionality setting, as do the digits 0 to 9; the Hebrew א (alef) is strongly right-to-left. Of course, some glyphs (common punctuation marks such as the period or comma for example) have weak or neutral settings because they may appear in several contexts. </p><p>The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (<a class="link_ref" href="BIB.html#WDBIDI" title="Mark Davis Aharon Lanin Andrew Glass Unicode Bidirectional AlgorithmUnicode Standard Annex 920130924">Unicode Consortium, 2013</a>) defines a number of rules enabling software to render sequences of characters which have differing directionality properties in a predictable and reliable way, using only those properties. <span id="Note63_return"><a class="notelink" title="Because this algorithm may not always give the desired result, Unicode also provides a set of &#34;directional formatting characters&#34; (). These additional…" href="#Note63"><sup>26</sup></a></span>. It should be remembered however that individual sequences of characters are always stored in a file in the order in which they should be read, irrespective of the order in which the characters making up a sequence should be displayed or rendered. For example, in a RTL language such as Hebrew, the first character in a file will be that which is displayed at the rightmost end of the first line of text.</p><p>An encoder wishing to document or to control the order in which sequences of characters in a TEI document are displayed will usually do so by segmenting the text into sequences presented in the desired order and specifying an appropriate language code for each. In situations where this approach may result in ambiguity or lack of precision, or if the encoder wishes to record directional information explicitly in their encoding, we recommend using the global @style attribute to supply detail about the writing mode applicable to the content of any element. The <span class="att">style</span> attribute (discussed in <a class="link_ptr" href="ST.html#STGAre" title="Rendition Indicators"><span class="headingNumber">1.3.1.1.3 </span>Rendition Indicators</a>) permits use of any formatting language; for these purposes however, we recommend use of CSS, which now includes a Writing Modes module <span id="Note64_return"><a class="notelink" title="At the time of writing, this W3C module has the status of a candidate recommendation: see further" href="#Note64"><sup>27</sup></a></span> which permits direct specification of a number of useful properties associated with writing modes, notably <code>direction</code> (<code>ltr</code> or <code>rtl</code>); <code>writing-mode</code> (<code>horizontal-tb</code>, <code>vertical-rl</code>, or <code>vertical-lr</code>); and <code>text-orientation</code> (<code>mixed</code>, <code>upright</code>, <code>sideways</code> ...)   as well as properties affecting the behaviour of the unicode-bidi (bidirectional) algorithm. We discuss and exemplify how these properties may be used below.</p><p>The global TEI <span class="att">style</span> attribute applies to the element on which it is specified (and in most cases, its descendants). Rather than specify it on every element, it will often be more efficient to express sets of commonly-used styling rules as <a class="gi" title="supplies information about the rendition or appearance of one or more elements in the source text." href="ref-rendition.html">rendition</a> elements in the <a class="gi" title="(TEI header) supplies descriptive and declarative metadata associated with a digital resource or set of resources." href="ref-teiHeader.html">teiHeader</a> and then point to them using the global <span class="att">rendition</span> attribute, as further discussed in <a class="link_ptr" href="HD.html#HD57-1" title="Rendition"><span class="headingNumber">2.3.4.1 </span>Rendition</a>. Although the CSS specifications are mainly used to provide instructions for software when rendering a digital text, they also provide a useful means of describing the visual properties of a pre-existing document in a formal and standardized way.</p><p>The next section presents some examples of how CSS can be used to describe a variety of writing modes. A full description of the appearance of a document will probably include many other properties of course. </p></div><div class="div2" id="WDWMEG"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"><span class="previousLink"> « </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#WDWM"><span class="headingNumber">5.6 </span>Writing Modes</a></li><li class="subtoc"><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#WDWMTT"><span class="headingNumber">5.8 </span>Text Rotation</a></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h3><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#WDWMEG" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: Examples of Different Writing Modes</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">5.7 </span><span class="head">Examples of Different Writing Modes</span></h3><p>The CSS recommendations provides several properties which can be used to encode aspects of the "writing mode".

In other words, glyphs are not rotated (although as noted above some different glyphs may be used for some characters, in particular for punctuation which needs to be positioned differently in vertical and in horizontal text). However, it is very common for languages written vertically to have embedded runs of text from languages which are normally written horizontally. This raises the issue of the orientation of the glyphs from the horizontal language. Are they written upright, as they would normally appear in horizontal text runs, or are they rotated? Consider this fragment from a Japanese article about the Indonesian language, which takes the form of a glossary list: </p><figure class="figure"><img src="Images/ja_vertical_indonesian_frag.png" alt="Detail from p.62 of " class="graphic" style=" width:250px;" /><figcaption class="caption">Figure 5.2.

Ogham is typically found inscribed along the edge of a standing stone, starting at its base. The CSS Writing Modes specification does not explicitly distinguish between vertical scripts which are written top-to-bottom and those which are written bottom-to-top. Instead, such bottom-to-top scripts are best treated as left-to-right horizontal scripts, oriented vertically because of the constraints of the medium on which they are inscribed. Such scripts are analogous to the vertical English text-runs in the table cells in the example above, and can be handled in exactly the same manner (<code>writing-mode: vertical-lr; text-orientation: sideways-left</code>). In cases where writing follows a curved path (such as Ogham running around the edge of a stone), a meticulous encoder might resort to the use of SVG to describe the path, rather than treating the phenomenon as a writing mode.</p></div><div class="div3" id="WDWMEG5"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"><span class="previousLink"> « </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#WDWMEG4"><span class="headingNumber">5.7.4 </span>Bottom-to-top Writing</a></li><li class="subtoc"><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#index-body.1_div.5_div.7_div.6"><span class="headingNumber">5.7.6 </span>Summary</a></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h4><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#WDWMEG5" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: Mixed Horizontal Directionality</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">5.7.5 </span><span class="head">Mixed Horizontal Directionality</span></h4><p>Returning to our previous simple example </p><pre class="pre_eg cdata">The Arabic term قلم رصاص means "pencil".</pre><p>we could use the direction property to make directionality explicit:</p><p><code>direction: ltr | rtl</code></p><div id="index-egXML-d50e57413" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;s <span class="attribute">xml:lang</span>="<span class="attributevalue">en</span>" <span class="attribute">style</span>="<span class="attributevalue">direction: ltr</span>"&gt;</span>The Arabic term<br /><span class="element">&lt;term <span class="attribute">xml:lang</span>="<span class="attributevalue">ar</span>"<br />  <span class="attribute">style</span>="<span class="attributevalue">direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed</span>"&gt;</span>قلم رصاص<span class="element">&lt;/term&gt;</span> means "pencil".<span class="element">&lt;/s&gt;</span></div><p>The use of the <code>direction</code> property to record the observed directionality of the text is unambiguous, even though it is (as we noted above) superfluous.

The CSS Writing Modes specification stipulates that the direction property <span class="quote">‘has no effect on bidi reordering when specified on inline boxes whose <code>unicode-bidi</code> property’s value is ‘normal’, because the element does not open an additional level of embedding with respect to the bidirectional algorithm.’</span></p><p>Mixed horizontal directionality is very common in languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, particularly when numbers (which are always given LTR) or phrases from LTR languages are embedded.

We can categorize these as text transformation features, and suggest some strategies for encoding them based on the properties detailed in the <a class="link_ref" href="BIB.html#CSSTM" title="Simon Fraser Dean Jackson Edward OConnor Dirk Schulze CSS Transforms Module Level 1 (W3C Working Draft)W3C26 November 2013">CSS Transforms (Fraser et al 2013)</a> specification. This CSS module provides a complex array of properties, values and functions which can be used to rotate, skew, translate and otherwise transform textual and graphical objects. We can borrow this vocabulary in order to describe textual phenomena in a precise manner.</p><p>We begin with a simple example of a rotational transform: </p><figure class="figure"><img src="Images/rotation_on_z_axis.png" alt="" class="graphic" /></figure><p>Here a block of text has been rotated around its z-axis. This is clearly not a ‘writing mode’; the writing mode for this text is horizontal, left to right. Furthermore, even if we wished to treat this as a writing mode, we could not do so, because there is no way to use writing modes properties to describe an text orientation which is angled at 45 degrees; no human languages are consistently written in this orientation. It is more appropriate to treat this as a rotational transformation. We can do this using two properties: <code>transform</code> and <code>transform-origin</code>. (Both of these properties have quite complex value sets, and we will not look at all of them here. See the <a class="link_ref" href="BIB.html#CSSTM" title="Simon Fraser Dean Jackson Edward OConnor Dirk Schulze CSS Transforms Module Level 1 (W3C Working Draft)W3C26 November 2013">specification</a> for full details.)</p><p>The <code>transform</code> property takes as its value one or more of the transform functions, one of which is the function <code>rotateZ()</code>:</p><div id="index-egXML-d50e57500" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;ab <span class="attribute">style</span>="<span class="attributevalue">transform:rotateZ(-45deg)</span>"&gt;</span>TEI-C.ORG<span class="element">&lt;/ab&gt;</span></div><p>Any rotation must take place clockwise around an axis positioned relative to the element being rotated, and the <code>transform-origin</code> property can be used to specify the pivot point. By default, the value of <code>transform-origin</code> is ‘50% 50%’, the point at the centre of the element, but these values can be changed to reflect rotation around a different origin point. (The TEI <a class="gi" title="defines any two-dimensional area within a &lt;surface&gt; element." href="ref-zone.html">zone</a> element also bears an attribute <span class="att">rotate</span> which can specify rotation in degrees around the z-axis, but it is not available for any other element.)</p><p>A block of text may also be rotated about either of its other axes. For example, this shows rotation around the Y (vertical) axis: </p><figure class="figure"><img src="Images/rotation_on_y_axis.png" alt="" class="graphic" /></figure><div id="index-egXML-d50e57527" class="pre egXML_valid"><span class="element">&lt;ab <span class="attribute">style</span>="<span class="attributevalue">transform:rotateY(45deg)</span>"&gt;</span>TEI-C.ORG<span class="element">&lt;/ab&gt;</span></div><p>These are obviously trivial examples, but similar features do appear in historical texts.

But the CSS Writing Modes specification does not provide support for boustrophedon, because it is a rather obscure historical phenomenon; using a rotational transform is one practical alternative. </p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="WDCAV"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"><span class="previousLink"> « </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#WDWMTT"><span class="headingNumber">5.8 </span>Text Rotation</a></li><li class="subtoc"><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#WSD-DEF"><span class="headingNumber">5.10 </span>Formal Definition</a></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h3><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#WDCAV" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: Caveat</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">5.9 </span><span class="head">Caveat</span></h3><p>As with other parts of the CSS specification, the intended effect of CSS Transforms properties and values is defined with reference to a specific <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html">Visual formatting model</a>; the language is designed to describe how an HTML document should be formatted. This is not, of course, the case for the TEI, which lacks any explicit processing or formatting model, and attempts to define objects as far as possible without consideration of their visual appearance. As long as the properties and values from the CSS Transforms module are used as a convenient, well-specified descriptive language to capture features of a text, without any expectation of using them directly and reliably for rendering, this is not particularly problematic. CSS provides a useful and well-defined vocabulary to describe many aspects of the appearance of source texts, benefitting particularly from the clarity of definition provided by the specification. However, if there is any expectation of using this information to render a text in a predictable and accurate way, it will be essential to provide enough styling information throughout the document hierarchy to resolve all ambiguities with regard to size, positioning, block status, etc. before any element undergoes a transform operation.</p></div><div class="div2" id="WSD-DEF"><div class="miniTOC miniTOC_right"><ul class="subtoc"><li class="subtoc"><span class="previousLink"> « </span><a class="navigation" href="WD.html#WDCAV"><span class="headingNumber">5.9 </span>Caveat</a></li><li class="subtoc"></li><li class="subtoc"><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Home</a></li></ul></div><h3><span class="bookmarklink"><a class="bookmarklink" href="#WSD-DEF" title="link to this section "><span class="invisible">TEI: Formal Definition</span><span class="pilcrow">¶</span></a></span><span class="headingNumber">5.10 </span><span class="head">Formal Definition</span></h3><p>The gaiji module described in this chapter makes available the following components: </p><dl class="moduleSpec"><dt class="moduleSpecHead"><span lang="en">Module</span> gaiji: Character and glyph documentation</dt><dd><ul><li><span lang="en">Elements defined</span>: <a class="link_odd" title="(character) provides descriptive information about a character." href="ref-char.html">char</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(character declarations) provides information about nonstandard characters and glyphs." href="ref-charDecl.html">charDecl</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(character name) contains the name of a character, expressed following Unicode conventions." href="ref-charName.html">charName</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(character property) provides a name and value for some property of the parent character or glyph." href="ref-charProp.html">charProp</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(character or glyph) represents a glyph, or a non-standard character." href="ref-g.html">g</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(character glyph) provides descriptive information about a character glyph." href="ref-glyph.html">glyph</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(character glyph name) contains the name of a glyph, expressed following Unicode conventions for character names." href="ref-glyphName.html">glyphName</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(locally-defined property name) contains a locally defined name for some property." href="ref-localName.html">localName</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(character mapping) contains one or more characters which are related to the parent character or glyph in some respect, as specified by the @type attribute." href="ref-mapping.html">mapping</a> <a class="link_odd" title="(unicode property name) contains the name of a registered Unicode normative or informative property." href="ref-unicodeName.html">unicodeName</a> <a class="link_odd" title="contains a single value for some property, attribute, or other analysis." href="ref-value.html">value</a></li></ul></dd></dl><p> The selection and combination of modules to form a TEI schema is described in <a class="link_ptr" href="ST.html#STIN" title="Defining a TEI Schema"><span class="headingNumber">1.2 </span>Defining a TEI Schema</a>.</p></div></div><nav class="left"><span class="upLink"> ↑ </span><a class="navigation" href="index.html">TEI P5 Guidelines</a><span class="previousLink"> « </span><a class="navigation" href="DS.html"><span class="headingNumber">4 </span>Default Text Structure</a><span class="nextLink"> » </span><a class="navigation" href="VE.html"><span class="headingNumber">6 </span>Verse</a></nav><!--Notes in [div]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="Note60"><span class="noteLabel">23 </span><div class="noteBody">Specifically, characters in the Unicode blocks Alphabetic Presentation Forms, Arabic Presentation Forms-A, Arabic Presentation Forms-B, Letterlike Symbols, and Number Forms.</div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#Note60_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="Note61"><span class="noteLabel">24 </span><div class="noteBody">It should be noted, however, that this naming convention cannot meaningfully be applied to East Asian characters; the typical Unicode descriptions for these characters take the form <span class="q">‘CJK Unified Ideograph <code>U+4E00</code>’</span>, where <code>U+4E00</code> is simply the Unicode code point value of the character in question.
