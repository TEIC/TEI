<head>Places</head>

<p>In <ptr target="#NDPLAC"/> we discuss various ways of naming
places such as towns, countries etc. In much the same way as these
guidelines distinguish between the encoding of names for people and
the encoding of other data about people, so they also distinguish
between the encoding of names for places and the encoding of other
data about places. In this section we present elements which may be
used to record in a structured way data about places of any kind which
might be named or referenced within a text. Such data may be useful as
a way of normalising or standardizing references to particular places,
as the raw material for a gazeteer or similar reference document
associated with a particular text or set of texts, or in conjunction
with any form of geographical information system.</p>

<p>The following elements are provided for this purpose:
<specList>
<specDesc key="listPlace"/>
<specDesc key="place"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>A <gi>place</gi> element will usually contain at least one, and
possibly several, <gi>placeName</gi>-like elements indicating the
names associated with it, by different people or at different times.
A place is defined, however, by its physical location. Locations may
be specified in a number of ways: as a set of co-ordinates defining a
point or an area on the surface of the earth, or by providing a
description of how the place may identified, usually in terms of other
placeNames. For example, we can identify the location of the Canadian
city of London, either by specifying its latitute and longitude, or by
specifying that we mean the city called London located in the province
called Ontario within the country called Canada. </p>

<p>In addition we may wish to supply a brief characterization of the place
identified, for example to state that it is a city, 
an administrative area such as a country, or a landmark of some kind
such as a monument or a battlefield. The following elements are
available within <gi>place</gi> for these purposes:
<specList>
<specDesc key="placeName"/>
<specDesc key="location"/> 
</specList>
</p>

<p> For example, the modern city of Lyon in France was in Roman times
known as Lugdunum. Although the modern and the Roman city are not
physically co-extensive, they have significant areas which overlap,
and we may therefore wish to regard them as the same place. In the
following example, we have defined the place <soCalled>Lyon</soCalled>
in terms of its geographical
co-ordinates specified using the Geographical Markup Language being
defined by the OGC<note place="foot">The OGC is an international
voluntary consensus standards organization whose members maintain the
Geography Markup Language standard. The OGC coordinates with the ISO
TC 211 standards organization to maintain consistency between OGC and
ISO standards work. GML is in the process of being adopted as an ISO
standard (ISO 19136) and is expected to be released as an
International Standard in 2007.</note> and indicated the two names
associated with it at different times:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><place xml:id="LYON1">
<placeName notBefore="1400">Lyon</placeName>
<placeName notAfter="56">Lugdunum</placeName>
<location><gml:Polygon>
  <gml:exterior>
   <gml:LinearRing>
   45.256 -110.45 46.46 -109.48 43.84 -109.86 45.8 -109.2 45.256 -110.45
   </gml:LinearRing>
   </gml:exterior>
</gml:Polygon></location>
<locale>city</locale>
</place>
</egXML>
</p>

<p>Alternatively, or in addition, we might identify Lyon by its
geo-political status as a settlement within a country forming part of
a larger political entity, independent of its geographic location:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<place xml:id="LYON2">
<placeName notBefore="1400">Lyon</placeName>
<placeName notAfter="56">Lugdunum</placeName>
<location><bloc>EU</bloc><country>France</country></location>
<locale>city</locale>
</place>
</egXML>
The elements <gi>bloc</gi> etc. are specialised forms of
<gi>placeName</gi>, as discussed in <ptr target="NDPLGU"/>. </p>

<p>The <att>type</att> attribute is available to categorize more
precisely both the kind of place concerned, and the kind of name used
to locate it. For example, a single building or a street may both be
regarded as a kind of place, just as a part of a <gi>location</gi>
called a <soCalled>district</soCalled> may also be more precisely
specified as an <soCalled>arrondissement</soCalled> as in this
example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<place type="building">
<placeName>Brasserie Georges</placeName>
<location>
  <country key="FR"/>
  <settlement type="city">Lyon</settlement>
  <district type="arrondissement">Perrache</district>
  <placeName type="street">Rue de la Charité</placeName>
</location>
<locale>Restaurant</locale>
</place></egXML>

</p>

<p>Over time, a place may change its name but not its location, or its
location and not its name, or both. These possibilities are all
catered for in the same way, by supplying multiple <gi>placeName</gi>
or <gi>location</gi> elements along with attributes taken from the
att.dating class. For example, we may indicate the differing physical
locations of Roman and modern Lyon as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<place xml:id="LYON3">
<placeName notBefore="1400">Lyon</placeName>
<placeName notAfter="-0056">Lugdunum</placeName>
<location notAfter="-0056"><gml:Polygon>
  <gml:exterior>
   <gml:LinearRing>
   45.1 -110.23 46.48 -99.08 31.74 -108.86 45.3 -78.2 42.25 -103.45
   </gml:LinearRing>
   </gml:exterior>
</gml:Polygon></location>
<location notBefore="1950"><gml:Polygon>
  <gml:exterior>
   <gml:LinearRing>
   45.256 -110.45 46.46 -109.48 43.84 -109.86 45.8 -109.2 45.256 -110.45
   </gml:LinearRing>
   </gml:exterior>
</gml:Polygon></location>
</place></egXML></p>



<p>We may know very little about a place: for example, we may know its
location but have no name for it:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<place xml:id="HARRYS">
<location>Junction of Park Street and Charlotte Street</location>
<locale>fire hydrant</locale>
</place>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>We may even wish to treat imaginary places in the same way:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<place>
<placename>Atlantis</placename>
<location>Unknown</location>
</place>
</egXML></p>

<p>The <gi>location</gi> element is not solely a way of naming or
identifying a place to a greater or lesser degree of precision: it is
used to physically locate a place whether by means of a name, a set of
names, or a set of co-ordinates. As in the following example, a
<gi>location</gi> sometimes resemble a set of instructions for finding
a place, rather than a name:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><place xml:id="MYF">
<placeName notAfter="1969">Yasgur's Farm</placeName>
<placeName notBefore="1969">Woodstock Festival Site</placeName>
<location>
 <measure>one mile</measure>
 <offset>north west of</offset>
 <settlement>Bethel</settlement>
 <region>New York</region>
</location>
<location scheme="latlong">41.687142 -74.870109</location>
</place>
</egXML>
<!-- or why not have explicit <lat> and <long> elements? -->
</p>

<p>A place may contain other places. The containment relation is
explicitly modelled in XML: thus we can say that the towns of Vilnius
and Kaunas are both in a place called Lithuania as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<place>
  <country>Lithuania</country>
  <country xml:lang="lt">Lietuva</country>
  <place>
       <settlement>Vilnius</settlement>
  </place>
  <place>
       <settlement>Kaunas</settlement>
  </place>
</place>     
</egXML>
</p>

<p>This does not, however, imply that Vilnius and Kaunas are the
only places constituting Lithuania; only that they are within it. A
separate <gi>place</gi> element may indicate that it is a part of
Lithuania by supplying a <gi>relation</gi> element, as discussed
below (<ptr target="#place-rel"/>).</p>

<p>Here is a more complex example, showing the variety of names
associated at different times and in different languages with a set
of hierarchically grouped places -- the settlement of Camarthen
Castle, within the town of Carmarthen, within the administrative county of
Carmarthenshire, Wales.

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<place xml:id="wales" type="country">
  <placeName xml:lang="cy">Cymru</placeName>
  <placeName xml:lang="en">Wales</placeName>
  <placeName xml:lang="la">Wallie</placeName>
  <placeName xml:lang="la">Wallia</placeName>
  <placeName xml:lang="fro">Le Waleis</placeName>
  <place xml:id="carmarthenshire" type="region" >
    <region type="county" xml:lang="en" notBefore="1284">Carmarthenshire</region>
    <place xml:id="carmarthen" type="settlement">
      <placeName xml:lang="en">Carmarthen</placeName>
      <placeName xml:lang="la" notBefore="1090" notAfter="1300">Kaermerdin</placeName>
      <placeName xml:lang="cy">Caerfyrddin</placeName>
      <place xml:id="carmarthen_castle" type="castle">
        <settlement>castle of Carmarthen</settlement>
      </place>
    </place>
  </place>
</place>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>As noted previously, <gi>country</gi>, <gi>region</gi>,
<gi>settlement</gi> are all specializations of the generic
<gi>placename</gi> element, and may not therefore be used as
specializations of the generic <gi>place</gi> element. If it is
desired to distinguish amongst kinds of <emph>place</emph> this can
only be done by means of the <att>type</att> attribute as in the above
example. The use of values for the type attribute which correspond to
the names of a naming element ("country", "region", "settlement") is
recommended when appropriate but not required. 
</p>

<!-- introduce use of listPlace -->


<p>These elements are specializations of the generic
<gi>state</gi> element, which performs a role for <gi>place</gi>
elements analogous to that it performs for <gi>person</gi> elements.
Also like people, places may be said
to have traits (characteristics such as climate, geographic type
etc.); we may also wish to record specific events about places, such
as their foundation or destruction. The following generic elements are
available for these purposes:
<specList>
<specDesc key="state"/>
<specDesc key="trait"/>
<specDesc key="event"/>
</specList>
</p>


<p>There is great variation in the kind of information which it might
be desired to record about places; we therefore do not here attempt to
enumerate the possible values which might be appropriate for the
<att>type</att> attribute on any of these generic elements. Places
identified in terms of their human habitation such as countries or
cities might have <gi>state</gi>s such as "population",
"administrative status" etc.; they may also have <gi>event</gi>s
such as "foundation date" or "destruction" etc. Almost any kind of
place is likely to have <gi>trait</gi>s such as "climate",
"terrain" etc. </p>

<p>Examples include:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><place xml:id="IS">
    <placeName xml:lang="en">Iceland</placeName>
    <placeName xml:lang="is">Ísland</placeName>
    <location type="latlong">65 00 N, 18 00 W</location>
    <trait type="area"><p>103,000 sq km</p></trait>
    <state type="gov" notBefore="1944"><p>Constitutional
republic</p></state>
    <state type="gov" notAfter="1944"><p>Part of the kingdom of
<placeName key="#DK">Denmark</placeName></p></state>
<placeEvent type="independence" from="1944-06-17"><p> Iceland became independent
on 17 June 1944.</p></placeEvent>
</place></egXML>


</p>
<div xml:id ="place-rel">
<p>The <gi>relation</gi> element may be used to express relationships
of various kinds between places, or between places and persons, in
much the same way as it is used to express relationships between
persons alone. For example, the islands of
Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues together form the Mascareignes Islands. One
way of representing this is as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<place type="islandGroup">
  <placeName>Mascareignes Islands</placeName>
  <place type="island">
    <placeName>Mauritius</placeName>
  </place>
  <place type="island">
    <placeName>Rodrigues</placeName>
  </place>
  <place type="island">
    <placeName>Réunion</placeName>
  </place>
</place>
</egXML>

but the same relationship could also be represented as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><listPlace>
  <place type="country" xml:id="FRA">
    <placeName>France</placeName>
  </place>

<place xml:id="MASC">
  <placeName>Mascareigne islands</placeName>
  <listPlace type="island" >
  <place xml:id="MRU">
    <placeName>Mauritius</placeName>
  </place>
  <place  xml:id="ROD">
    <placeName>Rodrigues</placeName>
  </place>
  <place  xml:id="REN">
    <placeName>Réunion</placeName>
  </place>
  </listPlace>
  <listPlace type="attol">
    <place>
      <placeName>La roche qui pleure</placeName>
    </place>
    <place>
      <placeName>Ile aux cerfs</placeName>
    </place>
  </listPlace>
</place>  
  </listPlace>
  <relation type="contains" active="#MASC" passive="#ROD #MRU #REN"/>

  <relation type="partOf" active="#REN" passive="#FRA #MASC"/>

              most of his design on a simple pencil. The clean,

              <p>The general contractors were <name

              Governor of New York. Excavation of the site began on
              <date value="1930-01-22">January 22, 1930</date>, and
              construction on the building itself started on <date

              3400 workers, mostly immigrants from Europe, along with
              hundreds of <name type="tribe">Mohawk nation</name> iron
              workers. According to official accounts, five workers
              died during the construction.</p>
              <p>The building was officially opened on <date
              value="1931-05-01">May 1, 1931</date> in dramatic
              fashion, when President <name type="person">Herbert
              Hoover</name> turned on the building's lights with the
              push of a button from <name type="place">Washington,

<div type="div2" xml:id="NDORG"><head>Organizational names</head>
<p>Like names of persons or places, organization names can be marked as
referent strings or as proper names with the <gi>rs</gi> and
<gi>name</gi> elements.  For certain applications it may be desirable
to mark the component parts of an organization. In some historical and
social science studies, for example, the component parts of an
organization names may  help to  characterize
the organization in terms of its geographical location, ownership,
likely number of employees, management structure etc.  

The elements
discussed in this section are recommended for this purpose and include:
<specList><specDesc key="orgName" atts="type key ref"/></specList>
</p>
<p>The <gi>orgName</gi> element may be used to mark up any form of
organizational name, that is, a name which applies to an organization
rather than an individual person or place.It is a
special case of a <gi>name</gi> and thus of an <gi>rs</gi> element.
Consequently, the following examples are synonymous, though the last is
preferred:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">About a year back, a question of considerable 
interest was agitated in the <rs key="PAS1" type="org">Pennsyla. Abolition Society</rs>.</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">About a year back, a question of considerable 
interest was agitated in the  <rs key="PAS1" type="org">
<name>Pennsyla. Abolition Society</name></rs>.</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">About a year back, a question of considerable 
interest was agitated in the 
<name key="PAS1" type="org">Pennsyla. Abolition 
Society</name>.</egXML>  
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">About a year back, a question of considerable 
interest was agitated in the <orgName type="voluntary" key="PAS1">Pennsyla. Abolition Society</orgName></egXML>
<!-- From the Diary of Thomas Pym Cope -->
Like the <gi>rs</gi> and <gi>name</gi> elements, the <gi>orgName</gi>
element has a <att>key</att> attribute with which an external
identifier such as a database key can be assigned to the organization
name, and also a <att>ref</att> attribute which can be used to point
directly to an <gi>org</gi> element containing information about the
organization itself (see further <ptr target="#ND-org"/>).  Its
<att>type</att> attribute should be used to characterize the name,
for example as an acronym:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Mr Frost will be able to earn an extra fee from 
<orgName type="acronym">BSkyB</orgName>
rather than the
<orgName  type="acronym">BBC</orgName>
</egXML>

as a phrase:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
The feeling in <country>Canada</country> is one of strong aversion to
the <orgName type="phrase">United States Government</orgName>, and of
predilection for self-government under the <orgName type="phrase">English Crown</orgName></egXML>
<!-- Anthony Trollope, North America, Penguin ed., 51 -->

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<orgName>The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu</orgName>
</egXML>

or as a composite of other kinds of name:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<orgName type="partnerNames">
         <surname>Ernst</surname>&amp;<surname>Young</surname>
</orgName></egXML>
 </p>
<p>The names making up an organization names are not always
personal. They may also include place names: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">A spokesman from 
<orgName type="regional">
  <orgName>IBM</orgName>
  <country>UK</country>
</orgName> said ... 
</egXML>
or role names:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">THE TICKET which you will receive herewith has been formed by
the <orgName>Democratic Whig <name type="role">party</name>
</orgName> after the most careful deliberation,
with a reference to all the great objects of NATIONAL, STATE,
COUNTY and CITY concern, and with a single eye to the <hi>Welfare and Best Interests of the Community</hi>.</egXML>
</p>
<p>As indicated above, organizational names may also be specified hierarchically
particularly where the named organization is itself a department
or a branch of a larger organizational entity.  <q>The
Department of Modern History, Glasgow University</q> is an
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><orgName>  
   <name type="org">Department of Modern History</name>
   <orgName><name type="city">Glasgow</name>
            <name type="role">University</name>
   </orgName>
</orgName></egXML>
</p>
<p>The formal declaration of the elements discussed in this section include:
<specGrp xml:id="DNDORG" n="Organization names">
&orgName;
<!--&orgTitle;
&orgType;
&orgDivn;--></specGrp>
